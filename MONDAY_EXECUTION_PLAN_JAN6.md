  - Enter gaps 3-7% if volume confirms

### 8:00 AM Check
- [ ] **Sector Leaders:** Which sectors gapping up?
  - Space gapping → LUNR, RDW, BKSY in play
  - Nuclear gapping → LEU, NNE, SMR in play
  - Multiple sectors → Scenario 1 (Rips)
  - One sector only → Scenario 4 (Rotation)

- [ ] **Volume:** Are gaps backed by volume?
  - 2x+ average vol = Real move

## ⏰ TIME-BASED EXITS (FIXES GAP #3)

### HOLDING PERIOD BY SCENARIO

**Scenario 1 (Rips):**
- Enter: 9:30-10:00 AM Monday
- Review: 3:00 PM Monday (if up 10%+, take half off)
- Exit: Tuesday EOD at latest
- DO NOT HOLD INTO WEDNESDAY (CES demos Jan 7-8)

**Scenario 2 (Dumps):**
- Enter: 10:00-11:00 AM Monday (after initial dump)
- Review: 2:00 PM Monday
- Exit: Monday EOD or Tuesday morning
- TIGHTER TIMELINE — market weakness = faster exit

**Scenario 3 (Consolidates):**
- No entries initially
- IF breakout Tuesday morning → Day trade only
- Exit same day

**Scenario 4 (Rotation):**
- Enter: When rotation confirmed (11:00 AM - 1:00 PM)
- Hold: Through Tuesday if thesis intact
- Exit: Before Wednesday CES demos

### EXIT RULES (ALL SCENARIOS)

- **Stop Hit:** Cut immediately, no questions
- **3 PM Monday:** Review all positions — if not working, cut before Tuesday

## 🔗 CORRELATION CHECK (FIXES GAP #4)

### Risk Buckets (Not Just Sectors)

| Bucket | Tickers | Correlation | Action |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Space High Beta** | LUNR, RDW, BKSY | 0.85+ | Pick MAX 2 |
| **Nuclear** | LEU, NNE, SMR | 0.70+ | Pick MAX 2 |
| **Crypto** | CLSK, MARA | 0.90+ | Pick MAX 1 |
| **Clean Energy** | PLUG | Independent | Safe |
| **EV** | LCID | Independent (but weak) | Caution |

**Diversification Rules:**
- MAX 2 from any single correlation bucket
- MUST have at least 3 different risk profiles
- If picking LUNR + RDW (both space), MUST add defensive play (LEU)

**Scenario 1 Portfolio Check:**
- LUNR, RDW, BKSY = 3 space plays = **TOO CORRELATED**
- FIX: Replace one space play with CLSK or PLUG

**Corrected Scenario 1:**
1. LUNR (Space)
2. LEU (Nuclear)
3. NNE (Nuclear)
4. CLSK (Crypto)
5. PLUG (Clean Energy)

**Result:** 4 sectors, 3 risk profiles, better diversification

## 🔄 MID-DAY PIVOT PROTOCOL (FIXES GAP #5)

### 10:30 AM Checkpoint
**Question:** Is the scenario we chose at open STILL valid?

**Triggers to Pivot:**
- SPY reverses 1%+ from open
- Our plays down >5% across the board
- Volume dies (50% of morning vol)
- Sector rotation happening

**Actions:**
| If Started With | And Now Seeing | Action |
|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Scenario 1 (Rips) | Market reversing down | Tighten stops to 5%, prepare to cut |
| Scenario 2 (Dumps) | Market bouncing hard | Add 1-2 quality names if bounce holds |
| Scenario 4 (Rotation) | Rotation reversing | Cut laggards, hold leaders |

### 12:00 PM Checkpoint
**Question:** Are we making money or bleeding?

**If Up 5%+ on portfolio:**
- Take 25-50% off table
- Move stops to breakeven on rest
- Let winners run with protection

**If Down 5%+ on portfolio:**
- Review each position
- Cut losers not bouncing
- Tighten stops on rest

### 2:00 PM Checkpoint
**Question:** Hold overnight or exit EOD?

**Hold Overnight IF:**
- Position up 5%+
- Volume still strong
- Thesis intact
- Market closing strong

**Exit EOD IF:**
- Position red or flat
- Low volume afternoon
- Market weakening
- Uncertainty overnight
