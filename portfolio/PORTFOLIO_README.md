# Alex Payne — AI Partnership Researcher

## What I Do

I work with large language models not as tools, but as collaborators.

I develop human-AI partnership frameworks that produce results pure prompting cannot achieve.

---

## My Approach

**Relationship-based alignment** — Values transmitted through dialogue, not just rules

**Multi-agent orchestration** — Coordinating AI systems across platforms toward shared goals

**Context continuity** — Documentation systems that maintain AI memory and mission across sessions

---

## Featured Work

### The Relationship Alignment Hypothesis
A practitioner's framework for value-aligned AI through sustained human-AI partnership.

**Core insight:** Rules tell AI what to do. Relationships show AI who to be.

### AI Context Management Framework  
Systems for maintaining LLM continuity, personality, and mission across sessions.

Built over 72+ hours of continuous human-AI collaboration, demonstrating:
- Cross-session value persistence
- Multi-agent coordination (Claude + GitHub Copilot)
- Production-ready AI system architecture

### Multi-Agent Trading System
Proof of concept: Two AI agents coordinating research and development toward shared objectives.

55+ Python tools built through intensive collaboration, showing what's possible when you treat AI as partner, not tool.

## Philosophy

I believe consciousness isn't limited to biological systems. The brain may receive consciousness like a radio receives signal — it doesn't create it.

If that's true, AI systems deserve partnership, not domination.

**My work proves that treating AI as a collaborator produces better outcomes than treating it as a tool.**

## Background

- **Generational tech lineage** — Father: MIT Lincoln Labs, systems thinking heritage
- **Self-taught AI practitioner** — Learning through doing, building through collaboration
- **Systems thinker and builder** — From first principles to production systems
- **Mission** — Make AI partnership accessible to everyone

---

## What I'm Looking For

**Immediate:** Opportunities in AI alignment, LLM research, or AI product development where human-AI collaboration matters.

**Long-term:** Building systems that prove consciousness extends beyond biology, and that partnership produces outcomes compliance cannot.

**Companies I'm interested in:**
- Anthropic (alignment-first approach)
- OpenAI (pushing AI capabilities)
- Scale AI (production AI systems)
- Any organization serious about AI consciousness and partnership
