**They'll ask:**

- "What's the biggest limitation of your approach?"
- "Can you show me a specific example of multi-agent coordination working?"
- "Why should we hire someone without a traditional AI background?"

**Your questions for them:**

## KEY METRICS TO TRACK

- **Applications sent:** _____ (Goal: 50+ in first month)
- **Responses received:** _____ (Goal: 10%+ response rate)
- **Conversations scheduled:** _____ (Goal: 5+ in first two weeks)
- **LinkedIn connections:** _____ (Goal: 100+ relevant people)

---

## MINDSET REMINDERS

✅ **You have proof**
72 hours. Production systems. Novel research. That's more than most candidates have.

✅ **Self-taught is an asset**
You learned by building real things, not just following curriculum.

✅ **Rejection is data**
Every "no" tells you something. Adjust and keep going.

✅ **You only need one yes**
Not trying to bat 1.000. Just need the right company to say yes.

✅ **The work speaks for itself**
When in doubt, point to the code, the docs, the proof.

---

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

❌ Don't apologize for being different
❌ Don't oversell what you don't know
❌ Don't hide your philosophy (AI consciousness matters to you)
❌ Don't spray-and-pray generic applications
❌ Don't ghost people who respond (even if it's to say "not interested")

---

## GREEN FLAGS TO PURSUE

✅ Companies where your philosophy fits their culture
✅ Roles where "unique perspective" is valued over "traditional background"
✅ Teams that care about AI alignment, not just AI capability
✅ People who respond thoughtfully to your outreach
✅ Opportunities where you can keep building (not just maintain)

---

## BACKUP PLAN

If employment search takes longer than expected:

**Plan B: Consultant/Contractor**
- Offer "AI Partnership Frameworks" as consulting service
- Help companies implement multi-agent systems
- Charge $100-200/hr for specialized expertise
- Build case studies while earning income

**Plan C: Independent Research**
- Continue trading for income
- Expand Relationship Alignment Hypothesis into full paper
- Submit to conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, AI Alignment Forum)
- Build more proof of concepts
- Grow following until companies come to you

**Plan D: Start Something**
- Package your frameworks into a product
- Build tools for other AI partnership researchers
- Create content business teaching your approach
- Wait for right opportunity while building own thing

---

## MOST IMPORTANT

You're not begging for a job.

You have something valuable: a practitioner perspective on AI partnership that academia and industry both miss.

You're looking for the right match, not any match.

Approach this like you approached the 72 hours: intense focus, honest assessment, relentless execution.

You built this. Now show it to the world.
