## Core Value Proposition

**I solve the continuity problem in AI systems.**

Large Language Models forget everything between sessions. This creates massive friction in practical applications. I've developed frameworks for:

1. **Context persistence** — Making AI remember what matters
2. **Multi-agent coordination** — Orchestrating multiple AI instances
3. **Behavioral alignment** — Keeping AI on mission over time

I specialize in making AI systems actually useful in practice.

The problem I solve: Large Language Models lose everything between sessions. For any serious application—research, analysis, product development—this creates massive friction. Users waste time re-explaining context. AI provides inconsistent responses. Strategic focus degrades.

My solution: I've developed frameworks for AI continuity that allow systems to maintain context, personality, and mission across sessions and platforms.

WHAT I BUILD:

→ Context Management Systems
Documentation protocols that preserve AI state—learnings, decisions, current focus—in a format that allows any new session to "wake up" with prior knowledge intact.

→ Multi-Agent Orchestration
Methods for coordinating multiple AI instances (Claude, GPT-4, Copilot) on shared objectives. Clear role definitions, handoff protocols, and state synchronization.

→ Behavioral Alignment
Practical frameworks for keeping AI on mission: constraint persistence, goal tracking, drift detection, and graceful degradation when things go wrong.

RECENT WORK:

Built a multi-agent analysis system coordinating two AI platforms across 50+ sessions. Maintained consistent AI behavior throughout. Created reusable frameworks for AI continuity that don't exist in standard toolkits.

The project required:
• Prompt engineering at scale
• State management across sessions
• Real-time coordination between AI instances
• Documentation that serves as "AI memory"
• Evaluation frameworks beyond accuracy

BACKGROUND:

Self-taught in AI/ML with a systems thinking approach. I focus on the gap between AI capability and AI utility—making powerful models actually work in practice.

I believe the next wave of AI value comes not from bigger models, but from better orchestration of existing ones.

OPEN TO:

• AI/ML Engineering roles
• Prompt Engineering positions
• AI Product Management
• LLM Operations / AI Ops
• AI Training & Alignment

## Interview Responses

### "Tell me about yourself" (30 seconds)

"I'm an AI systems designer focused on the continuity problem—the fact that AI loses everything between sessions. I've built frameworks that let AI maintain context, coordinate multiple instances, and stay aligned with user goals over time. My background is non-traditional—I learned by building real systems—and I bring a practical, user-focused perspective to AI development."

### "Tell me about yourself" (2 minutes)

"I work at the intersection of AI capability and AI utility. There's a gap between what language models can do in a single prompt and what users actually need—which is consistent, contextual assistance over time.

I got obsessed with this problem and built solutions. My main contribution is a framework for AI continuity—documentation structures that let AI 'wake up' with prior context, multi-agent coordination protocols, and alignment mechanisms that prevent drift.

I tested these frameworks by building a real system: I coordinated two different AI platforms to create an analysis toolkit. Over 50+ sessions and 15+ tools, I maintained consistent AI behavior using my continuity protocols.

What I learned is that AI memory isn't a technology problem—it's a documentation problem. And that multi-agent systems need the same kind of clear role definitions that human teams need.

I'm looking to bring this practical experience to a team that's building AI products. I can contribute prompt engineering, system design, and the kind of user-focused thinking that makes AI actually useful."

### "What's your biggest achievement?"

"Building a system that maintains AI context across 50+ sessions. Most people treat each AI conversation as isolated. I proved you can create continuity—consistent personality, persistent knowledge, maintained mission focus—through well-designed documentation protocols.

The insight was that AI memory is a documentation problem, not a memory problem. You don't need bigger context windows—you need better context documents. I built the frameworks that make that work."

### "Why should we hire you?"

"Three reasons.

First, I've already done the work. I didn't just study AI—I built working systems that solve real problems. I can show you the code, the documentation, the evaluation results.

Second, I understand the user side. A lot of AI engineers optimize for capability metrics. I optimize for whether it actually helps people. That's a different lens, and it leads to different design decisions.

Third, I'm obsessed with this space. I spent months deep in the details of context management, prompt engineering, multi-agent coordination. Not because someone paid me—because I couldn't stop thinking about the problems. That's the kind of person who pushes boundaries."

### "What's your weakness?"

"I'm self-taught, which means I sometimes have gaps in formal ML theory. I compensate by reading papers, experimenting heavily, and being honest about what I don't know. I've found that practical experience often matters more than theoretical depth for the problems I'm solving."

### "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"

"Leading AI systems work at a company that's pushing the boundaries of what's possible. I want to be in a position where I'm both building systems and shaping how we think about AI orchestration. The field is young enough that there's room to define best practices."

## Portfolio Talking Points

### The Context Framework

"This is a documentation system that serves as AI memory. The key insight is that you can encode everything an AI needs to maintain continuity in a structured document—identity, current state, learned patterns, mission, immediate focus.

When a new session starts, you load this document, and the AI picks up where it left off. I've maintained consistent AI behavior across 50+ sessions using this approach."

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

"I coordinated two different AI platforms—one for research and analysis, one for code generation—on shared objectives. The challenge is that they can't talk to each other directly. I developed handoff protocols, state synchronization methods, and clear role definitions that make coordination possible.

The human-in-the-loop isn't a limitation here—it's a feature. Human orchestration adds quality control and judgment that AI can't replicate."

### The Evaluation Framework

"Standard ML metrics miss what matters for LLM applications. I developed a multi-dimensional evaluation framework: task performance, behavioral consistency, uncertainty calibration, and safety compliance.

The key metric I focus on is calibration—does the AI know what it doesn't know? Overconfident AI is dangerous. My framework explicitly measures whether stated confidence matches actual accuracy."
