# Trading Companion 2026: Blueprint & Vision

## 1. Vision Statement

Build an AI-powered trading companion for 2026 that acts as a mission control for active traders. The system synthesizes research, watchlists, risk rules, and scenario-based decision frameworks to help you:
- Anticipate market moves
- Validate new ideas
- Manage risk dynamically
- Execute with discipline

## 2. Problems We’re Solving
- Information overload: Too many tickers, sectors, and news to track
- Lack of synthesis: Research, watchlists, and rules are scattered
- Emotional trading: Need for discipline, scenario planning, and risk management
- Missed opportunities: No system for surfacing actionable ideas at the right time
- Validation: How to quickly vet new tickers or catalysts

## 3. Core Ideas & Strategic Stack

### A. Strategic Watchlists & Sectors
- YAML-based watchlists for 2026: Defense, AI, Biotech, Fintech, Battery Metals, Space, EV, Quantum, Cybersecurity, Cleantech, Robotics, AgTech, Water, Consumer Tech
- Sectors, curated lists, and a master ticker list

### B. The AI Oxygen Map (Thesis)
- AI is infrastructure: Invest in what every AI company needs (compute, memory, power, cooling, equipment, grid, raw materials)
- Layered approach: Compute, Memory, Storage, Networking, Power, Cooling, Equipment, Data Centers, Raw Materials
- “Oxygen” stocks: Monopoly/critical suppliers (ASML, MU, LEU, TSM, etc.)
- Account-size playbook: What to buy at each price tier

### C. War Games & Scenario Planning
- “What if” playbooks for market events (gap downs, new tickers, sector rotations)
- System responses: What the companion should do in each scenario
- Example: “SIDU gaps down 15% pre-market — system flags, checks news, risk, and suggests action”

### D. Risk & Execution Rules
- Stop loss, position sizing, and risk management frameworks
- Advanced chart reading and checklist docs
- Mindset and discipline reminders

### E. Research & Synthesis Docs
- Markdown files: sector rules, mission control, aggressive alpha, master synthesis, etc.
- Extracted “war games” docs: layouts, indicator guides, ticker lists, system prompts, etc.

## 4. The Roadmap (Next Steps)
1. **Organize**: Map all ideas, docs, and watchlists into a unified structure
2. **Prioritize**: Identify the MVP — what features give the most value on day one?
3. **Architect**: Design the system (data flows, modules, UI/UX)
4. **Build**: Start with core watchlist + scenario engine, then iterate

## 5. Example “War Game” Scenarios
- “It’s January 2nd, market opens — what does your companion tell you?”
- “SIDU gaps down 15% pre-market — what does the system do?”
- “You found a new ticker on the scanner — how does the companion help you validate it?”

## 6. Repo Contents (Idea Stack)
- **watchlists.yaml**: All 2026 strategic watchlists, sectors, curated lists, master ticker list
- **AI_OXYGEN_MAP.md**: The full AI infrastructure investing thesis
- **sector_rules_2026.md, mission_control_2026.md, chart_reading_3line_rule.md, chart_checklist_advanced.md, stop_loss_and_layout4.md, trading_mindset_reasons.md, trading_war_game_system.md, aggressive_alpha_strategy.md, master_war_game_synthesis.md, aggressive_war_games_2026.md**: Strategic docs
- **war_games_docs/**: Extracted research, scenario prompts, layouts, indicator guides, ticker lists, and more

## 7. What’s Next?
- Review the blueprint above
- Help organize and prioritize features for the MVP
- Design the architecture before coding
- Use “war games” to validate what’s actually useful

## (Below: Stakeholder/Collaborator Message)

You've got a repo full of ideas — a blueprint, not a product yet.

Let's see it.

Upload the files or copy-paste your notes. I want to see:

- What ideas have you stacked?
- What's the vision?
- What problems are you trying to solve?

Then we can:

- Organize it — Turn scattered ideas into a real roadmap
- Prioritize — What do we build FIRST that gives you the most value?
- Architect — Design the system before writing code
- Build — Start small, get something working, iterate

The "War Games" approach:
I like this. We can run scenarios:

- "It's January 2nd, market opens, what does your companion tell you?"
- "SIDU gaps down 15% pre-market, what does the system do?"
- "You found a new ticker on the scanner, how does the companion help you validate it?"

This helps us figure out what we ACTUALLY need to build vs what sounds cool but won't help you trade.
