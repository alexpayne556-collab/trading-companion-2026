## 📊 DURING MARKET HOURS (10:00 AM - 4:00 PM)

### Active Monitoring

**10:00 AM - 11:00 AM**: Let position settle
- Don't touch it
- Watch for volume confirmation
- Volume >500K first hour = good sign
- Volume <100K first hour = weak interest

**11:00 AM**: First check-in
- Price vs entry: Green or red?
- Volume vs average: High or low?
- Any news catalysts?
- If down >5% but no bad news = HOLD
- If up >10% = set trailing stop at break-even

**12:00 PM - 2:00 PM**: Midday lull
- Low volume expected
- Don't react to normal chop
- Only act if:
  - Stop triggered ($2.30 hit)
  - Major news breaks
  - Unusual volume spike

**2:00 PM - 4:00 PM**: Power hour
- Watch for late-day momentum
- Institutions often buy/sell in last hour
- If strong finish >3% up = bullish
- If weak finish <-3% = watch for breakdown

**What NOT to do**:
- ❌ Don't panic sell on -3% move

## 🚨 RISK MANAGEMENT RULES

### When to Exit EARLY (Before Stop)

**Thesis Breaks** (exit immediately):
- Major insider selling announced
- Dilution announced (equity raise)
- Contract cancelled / bad guidance
- Accounting scandal / SEC investigation

**Technical Breaks** (watch closely):
- Break below $2.71 (52-week low)
- Volume dries up (<50K daily average)
- Pattern change to downtrend

**Opportunity Cost** (consider exit):
- Better opportunity appears
- Dead money for 30+ days
- Other positions need capital

### When to Add (If Ever)

**Only if ALL conditions met**:
1. New insider buying (additional cluster)
2. Price pulls back to $2.50-2.60
3. We have $100+ cash available
4. Original thesis still intact
5. No better opportunities exist

**Add amount**: Max $100 (keep total <$300)
