## SIGNAL SCORING MATRIX

### High Conviction Play (Score 70+)
Multiple signals firing together:
- Insider buying + Government contract = 🔥🔥🔥
- Analyst upgrade + Earnings beat = 🔥🔥
- Short squeeze setup + Positive catalyst = 🔥🔥🔥

### Medium Conviction (Score 40-69)
Single strong signal:
- Government contract alone = Good, but verify
- Analyst initiation alone = Watch for follow-through
- Momentum alone = Risky without catalyst

### Low Conviction (Score <40)
Technical only:
- Just price/volume patterns
- No fundamental catalyst
- Pure chart plays (our wounded prey candidates)

## THE INSIGHT

**Before:** "SMR has no insider buying = skip"
**After:** "SMR scores 25/150 on multi-signal = skip, but SOUN scores 80 even without insider buying because of OTHER strong signals"

**Insider buying is GREAT when present.**
**Absence of insider buying is NOT automatically disqualifying if other signals are strong.**

## THE WOLF PACK EDGE

**They have Bloomberg.** One tool that does everything.

**We build custom scanners** that find what THEY miss:
- Small caps they don't cover
- Signals they don't combine
- Speed they can't match (we're ONE trader, not a committee)

**Our multi-signal system catches:**
- Insider buying (what smart money does)
- Analyst coverage (what Wall Street says)
- Government contracts (what pays the bills)
- Short squeezes (what amplifies moves)
- Earnings beats (what proves the business)

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Thursday (Jan 2)
- Apply multi-signal scoring to all watchlist tickers
- Focus on AISP (highest score in our range)
- Watch SOUN for entry (high score, squeeze potential)

### Phase 2: This Week
- Build enhanced scanner with all 10 signals
- Create automated scoring system
- Test on historical data

### Phase 3: Ongoing
- Run daily multi-signal scans
- Track which signals predict best
- Refine weights based on results
