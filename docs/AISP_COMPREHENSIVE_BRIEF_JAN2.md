## ⚠️ WHAT'S CONCERNING (Risks)

### 1. Dilution Risk - MODERATE 🚨
- **S-3 shelf registration filed October 28, 2025** (2 months ago)
- Allows company to issue shares "on the shelf" anytime
- Recent 8-K (Dec 10): Charter amendments (Item 5.03)
  - Could include authorized share increases
  - Could include reverse split authority
  - **Need manual review of actual 8-K text**
- **Mitigation**: Company has 28-month cash runway, no immediate need

### 2. Profitability - NOT PROFITABLE 🚨
- **Trailing EPS: -$1.88** (losing money)
- Revenue: $12.0M (small but growing)
- EBITDA: -$8.1M (negative)
- Profit margin: 0.00%
- Free cash flow: -$2.5M annually

### 3. Cash Burn - MANAGEABLE ⚠️
- Total cash: **$5.7M**
- Quarterly burn: **$620K**
- **Runway: 28 months** (9.3 quarters)
- Debt: $967K (minimal)
- **Assessment**: Not immediate crisis, but watch quarterly reports

### 4. Sector Weakness - HEADWIND ⚠️
- Small cap AI/tech getting hammered recently:
  - IONQ: -16.69% last week
  - QBTS: -18.76% last week  
  - PLUG: -6.64% last week
- AISP: -3.67% last week (following sector)
- **Risk**: Sector out of favor = harder to move up
- **Opportunity**: Buying when others are fearful

### 5. Limited Institutional Support - NEUTRAL ⚠️
- Only 25.49% institutional ownership (low for growth stock)
- No major funds (no Ark, Cathie Wood, etc.)
- **Risk**: Less buying pressure from large players
- **Opportunity**: Room for discovery if story develops

### 6. Valuation Metrics - EXPENSIVE ⚠️
- Forward P/E: 57.80 (high for unprofitable company)
- Revenue: Only $12M (early stage)
- No trailing P/E (not profitable)
- **Assessment**: Priced for growth that must materialize

## 📈 PRICE TARGETS & SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Conservative (60% probability)
- **Target**: $3.50 (+21% from $2.89)
- **Catalyst**: Sector stabilization + insider confidence plays out modestly
- **Timeline**: 30-45 days
- **Action**: Sell 25% at $3.50, lock ~$13 profit
- **P&L**: +$13 on $200 = +6.5% account gain

### Scenario 2: Base Case (30% probability)
- **Target**: $4.50 (+56% from $2.89)
- **Catalyst**: New contract announcement, earnings beat, sector rotation
- **Timeline**: 60-90 days
- **Action**: Sell 50% of remaining at $4.50
- **P&L**: +$86 on $200 = +6.7% account gain

### Scenario 3: Wolf Pack (10% probability)
- **Target**: $7.00-7.20 (+142% to +149%)
- **Catalyst**: Major partnership, acquisition interest, breakout story
- **Timeline**: 90-180 days
- **Action**: Trail stop 20%, let it run to 52-week high
- **P&L**: +$284-298 on $200 = +22-23% account gain

### Scenario 4: Stop Loss (assume 25% probability)
- **Exit**: $2.30 (-20% from $2.89)
- **Catalyst**: Dilution announced, thesis breaks, sector crashes
- **Timeline**: Any time
- **P&L**: -$40 to -50 = -3.1% to -3.9% account loss

### Expected Value Calculation
```
EV = (0.60 × $13) + (0.30 × $86) + (0.10 × $291) - (0.25 × $45)
EV = $7.80 + $25.80 + $29.10 - $11.25
EV = $51.45 on $200 position
EV = +25.7% expected return
```

**Note**: This doesn't include stop loss probability in the 3 upside scenarios. Adjusting:

```
Win probability: 60% + 30% + 10% = 100% (of wins)
But need to account for stop hitting first

Adjusted:
Success scenarios: 75% probability (composite)
Stop loss: 25% probability

EV = (0.75 × $64.80) - (0.25 × $45)
EV = $48.60 - $11.25  
EV = $37.35 on $200 = +18.7% expected return
```

**Verdict**: Positive expected value trade ✅

## 🛡️ RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN

### Entry Rules
- **Ideal zone**: $2.70-2.80 (on weakness)
- **Acceptable zone**: $2.80-2.90 (current range)
- **Abort if**: Gaps up >10% ($3.20+), wait for pullback
- **Abort if**: Pre-market news of dilution
- **Abort if**: Volume <500K at open (no interest)

### Position Sizing
- **Amount**: $200
- **Shares**: 69-86 depending on fill
- **% of account**: 15.6%
- **Max risk**: $40-50 (3.1-3.9% of account) ✅

### Stop Loss
- **Hard stop**: $2.30
- **Rationale**: Below 52-week low ($2.71), -15 to -20% loss
- **Do NOT move lower**: Only trail up when profitable
- **Exit if**: Stop triggers OR thesis breaks

### Thesis Break Exits (Immediate)
- Dilution/equity raise announced
- Major insider selling (any executive)
- Accounting issues/SEC investigation
- Key contract cancelled
- Guidance slashed

### Profit Taking Ladder
```
$3.50 (+21%): Sell 25% = Lock $10-15
$4.50 (+56%): Sell 50% of remaining = Lock $45-50 total
$7.00+ (+142%): Trail stop 20%, let runner work
```

### Time-Based Management
- **30 days**: Check progress, any catalysts?
- **60 days**: Should be at least break-even or near Target 1
- **90 days**: If dead money with no thesis development, exit

- Kang-Kim-Wang: 3+ insiders = 2.1% MONTHLY abnormal returns
- AISP: 3 insiders = TEXTBOOK cluster setup

### Recency Matters - VALIDATED ✅

- This is not routine portfolio rebalancing

### 10b5-1 Plans - CLEAN ✅
