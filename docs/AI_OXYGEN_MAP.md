## THE CORE THESIS

AI is not a product. AI is INFRASTRUCTURE. Like electricity in 1900 or the internet in 1995.

You don't bet on which light bulb company wins. You bet on:
- Copper wire (transmission)
- Power plants (generation)
- The companies that make the equipment to build it all

**Your edge:** You're not asking "which AI company wins?" You're asking "what does EVERY AI company need regardless of who wins?"

---

## LAYER 1: COMPUTE (The Brain)

What it does: Processes the math. Every AI calculation happens here.

### The Players

| Ticker | Company | Role | Price Range | Moat Level |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|------------|
| NVDA | NVIDIA | GPU leader, 80%+ AI chip market | ~$140 | HIGH but threatened |
| AMD | AMD | #2 GPU, gaining share | ~$120 | MEDIUM |
| AVGO | Broadcom | Custom AI chips for hyperscalers | ~$230 | HIGH |
| MRVL | Marvell | Custom silicon, networking | ~$110 | MEDIUM |
| INTC | Intel | Trying to catch up, fabs | ~$20 | LOW but cheap |

### The Insight

NVDA dominates but you said it yourself — they're at risk. China restrictions, competition coming. The REAL oxygen isn't the chip maker, it's who makes the EQUIPMENT to make the chips.

---

## LAYER 2: MEMORY (The Short-Term Brain)

What it does: Holds the AI model while it runs. Without memory, compute is useless.

### Why This Matters

An AI model like me needs to be LOADED into memory to think. Bigger models = more memory needed. This is YOUR position with MU.

### The Players

| Ticker | Company | Role | Price Range | Moat Level |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|------------|
| MU | Micron | DRAM + NAND + HBM | ~$102 | HIGH |
| (Private) | SK Hynix | HBM leader (Korean) | N/A | HIGHEST |
| (Private) | Samsung | Memory + foundry | N/A | HIGH |

### The Next Innovation: HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)

This is the real play. HBM is memory STACKED directly on top of AI chips. It's 10x faster than regular memory.

- Every NVDA H100/H200 chip needs HBM
- MU is ramping HBM3E production
- This is why MU matters more than people realize

**You already own this oxygen.**

## LAYER 3: STORAGE (The Long-Term Memory)

What it does: Saves all the data — training data, model weights, user data.

### The Players

| Ticker | Company | Role | Price Range | Moat Level |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|------------|
| WDC | Western Digital | HDDs + SSDs | ~$65 | MEDIUM |
| STX | Seagate | HDDs for mass storage | ~$100 | MEDIUM |
| PSTG | Pure Storage | Enterprise flash | ~$65 | MEDIUM |
| NTAP | NetApp | Data management | ~$115 | MEDIUM |

### The Insight

Storage is commoditized — harder to find an "oxygen" play here. Data keeps growing but margins are thin.

---

## LAYER 4: NETWORKING (The Nervous System)

What it does: Moves data between chips, servers, and data centers. Speed matters.

### Why This Is A Bottleneck

AI training uses THOUSANDS of chips talking to each other simultaneously. If the network is slow, everything waits. This is becoming a huge constraint.

### The Players

| Ticker | Company | Role | Price Range | Moat Level |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|------------|
| ANET | Arista Networks | Data center switches | ~$115 | HIGH |
| CSCO | Cisco | Networking (older tech) | ~$60 | MEDIUM |
| MRVL | Marvell | Networking chips | ~$110 | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| AVGO | Broadcom | Networking + custom chips | ~$230 | HIGH |
| COHR | Coherent | Fiber optics | ~$105 | MEDIUM |
| LITE | Lumentum | Optical components | ~$85 | MEDIUM |

### The Hidden Oxygen: InfiniBand

NVDA bought Mellanox (InfiniBand networking). This is how AI clusters communicate. NVDA doesn't just sell chips — they sell the whole system.

---

## LAYER 5: POWER (The Electricity)

What it does: Runs everything. Data centers are POWER HUNGRY.

### The Numbers That Matter

- A single AI data center can use 100+ MW
- That's enough to power 80,000 homes
- AI compute demand is growing 30-50% per year
- The grid CAN'T keep up

### This Is Where Nuclear Comes In

Why nuclear for AI?
- 24/7 baseload power (solar/wind are intermittent)
- Carbon-free (tech companies have climate commitments)
- High density (small footprint, massive output)
- Microsoft, Google, Amazon ALL signing nuclear deals

### The Players

**Nuclear Fuel & Uranium:**
| Ticker | Company | Role | Price Range | Notes |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| LEU | Centrus | ONLY U.S. HALEU producer | ~$250 | Monopoly position |
| CCJ | Cameco | Largest uranium miner | ~$55 | Blue chip |
| UEC | Uranium Energy | U.S. uranium producer | ~$7 | Oversold |
| UUUU | Energy Fuels | Uranium + rare earths | ~$6 | Dual exposure |
| DNN | Denison Mines | Development stage | ~$2 | Speculative |

**SMR Developers:**
| Ticker | Company | Role | Price Range | Notes |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| OKLO | Oklo | SMR developer, Sam Altman backed | ~$75 | Pre-revenue |
| SMR | NuScale | Only NRC-approved SMR | ~$15 | Dilution risk |
| LTBR | Lightbridge | Advanced fuel | ~$13 | Pre-revenue |
| BWXT | BWX Technologies | Naval reactors, SMR components | ~$130 | Profitable |

**Nuclear Utilities:**
| Ticker | Company | Role | Price Range | Notes |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| CEG | Constellation | Largest U.S. nuclear fleet | ~$230 | Microsoft deal |
| VST | Vistra | 2nd largest nuclear fleet | ~$170 | Best performer 2024 |
| TLN | Talen Energy | Nuclear + data centers | ~$250 | Amazon deal |

### Your Nuclear Thesis Refined

Forget SMR for now — they're pre-revenue and risky.

**The oxygen plays in nuclear:**
1. LEU — monopoly on HALEU fuel, actual revenue
2. CCJ — you need uranium, they have it
3. CEG/VST — they have working reactors NOW

---

## LAYER 6: COOLING (The AC)

What it does: Keeps chips from melting. AI chips run HOT.

### Why This Matters Now

- NVDA H100 chips run at 700W each
- Data centers are hitting thermal limits
- Air cooling isn't enough anymore
- LIQUID COOLING is becoming required

### The Players

| Ticker | Company | Role | Price Range | Moat Level |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|------------|
| VRT | Vertiv | Data center cooling + power | ~$130 | HIGH |
| CARR | Carrier Global | HVAC systems | ~$65 | MEDIUM |

### The Hidden Play: Liquid Cooling

This is early. Most liquid cooling companies are private or part of larger companies. VRT is your best pure-play exposure.

---

## LAYER 7: EQUIPMENT (The Factory Builders)

What it does: Makes the machines that make the chips.

### THIS IS THE ULTIMATE OXYGEN

You don't need to pick which chip company wins. EVERY chip company needs these machines.

### The Players

| Ticker | Company | Role | Price Range | Moat Level |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|------------|
| ASML | ASML | EUV lithography MONOPOLY | ~$730 | ABSOLUTE MONOPOLY |
| AMAT | Applied Materials | Deposition, etch, process | ~$175 | HIGH |
| LRCX | Lam Research | Etch and deposition | ~$80 | HIGH |
| KLAC | KLA Corp | Inspection and testing | ~$750 | HIGH |

### The ASML Story

This is the most important company most people don't know.

- ASML makes EUV lithography machines
- These machines cost $300+ MILLION each
- They are the ONLY company that makes them
- Every advanced chip (NVDA, AMD, Apple) requires ASML machines
- There is NO alternative

**If you can only buy ONE stock in this entire map, it's ASML.**

Problem: It's $730/share. You'd need fractional shares.

---

## LAYER 8: DATA CENTER INFRASTRUCTURE

What it does: The buildings, land, and physical infrastructure.

### The Players

| Ticker | Company | Role | Price Range | Moat Level |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|------------|
| DLR | Digital Realty | Data center REIT | ~$185 | HIGH |
| EQIX | Equinix | Data center REIT | ~$950 | HIGH |
| AMT | American Tower | Tower + data center | ~$180 | MEDIUM |

### The Grid Players

| Ticker | Company | Role | Price Range | Notes |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| ETN | Eaton | Power management | ~$320 | Blue chip |
| PWR | Quanta Services | Grid construction | ~$330 | Building the grid |
| GEV | GE Vernova | Power equipment | ~$340 | Grid transformation |

---

## LAYER 9: RAW MATERIALS (The Elements)

What it does: The actual physical stuff everything is made from.

### The Players

| Ticker | Company | Role | Price Range | Notes |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| FCX | Freeport-McMoRan | Copper (wiring, everything) | ~$40 | Blue chip |
| MP | MP Materials | Rare earths (magnets, chips) | ~$20 | Only U.S. producer |
| UUUU | Energy Fuels | Uranium + rare earths | ~$6 | Dual exposure |
| ALB | Albemarle | Lithium (batteries) | ~$110 | |

**The cat's meow is this:**

Every AI chip needs:
1. ASML machine to be born
2. MU memory to think
3. Power to run
4. Cooling to survive
5. Network to communicate

You already own #2. Now you know the rest of the oxygen.

The question isn't IF these things are needed. They ARE needed. The question is WHEN to buy them.

That's where your trigger checklist comes in:
- News ✓
- Insider buying ✓
- Volume ✓
- Sentiment ✓
- Macro confirmation ✓

Wait for 3/5 triggers. Then deploy.
