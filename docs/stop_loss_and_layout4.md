# STOP LOSS - THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
# How to Use Stop Losses and Why They Matter
# Source: User's stop loss rules and layout notes, December 2025

## WHAT IS A STOP LOSS?
A stop loss is an automatic order that says:
"If the price drops to $X, SELL MY SHARES AUTOMATICALLY."
You set it and forget it. It protects you while you sleep, eat, or aren't watching.

## WHY TRADERS LOSE MONEY WITHOUT STOPS
WITHOUT STOP LOSS:
- You buy at $10.30
- It drops to $10.00... "It'll come back"
- It drops to $9.50... "I'll wait"
- It drops to $8.00... "I can't sell now, I'm down too much"
- It drops to $6.00... "I'll just hold forever"
- You lost 42% and your account is destroyed

WITH STOP LOSS:
- You buy at $10.30
- You set stop at $9.80
- It drops to $9.80
- YOU'RE OUT AUTOMATICALLY
- You lost 5% ($0.50 per share)
- You still have 95% of your money to try again
Small losses are fine. Big losses kill accounts.

## HOW TO SET A STOP LOSS IN FIDELITY
After you BUY shares, immediately create a SELL order:
- Order Type: STOP (not "limit", not "market")
- Action: SELL
- Quantity: Same as what you bought
- Stop Price: Your stop loss price
- Time in Force: GTC (Good Til Cancelled) or DAY
  - GTC = Stays active until it triggers or you cancel it
  - DAY = Expires at end of trading day

## WHERE TO PUT YOUR STOP
Rule: Put your stop where your THESIS is wrong.
- If you bought because price is above support at $10.00:
  → Stop goes BELOW $10.00 (like $9.80)
  → If price breaks $10.00, your reason for buying is gone
- If you bought because price broke above resistance at $10.50:
  → Stop goes BELOW $10.50 (like $10.30)
  → If it falls back below, the breakout failed
- Never put your stop at a random number. Always at a LEVEL that means something.
