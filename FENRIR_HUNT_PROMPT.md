## THE BATTLEFIELD SETUP (Sunday Night Jan 5)

### CES 2026 Moving NOW (Not Tomorrow)
Our CES Monitor just scanned and found:
- **QBTS**: +9.4% Friday (Masterclass Jan 7 at 1PM)
- **QUBT**: +11.3% Friday (Demos Jan 7-8)
- **RR**: +10.8% Friday (Humanoid robot demo)
- **RDW**: +13.3% Friday (Space contracts, NOT CES)
- **RGTI**: +6.6% Friday (No CES presence - sympathy)
- **IONQ**: +5.0% Friday (No CES presence - sympathy)

**Question 1:** Are we CHASING if we enter Monday? Or is there runway left before CES Wed-Thurs?

### Nuclear Sector Rally (Jan 2-3)
- URA: +7.79%
- LEU: +12.25%
- CCJ: +7.7%
- UUUU: +14.7%
- SMR: +15.1% (NO NEWS - red flag?)

**Question 2:** Is this rotation sustainable or a short squeeze trap?

### Space Momentum
- RDW at $10.04: 139% analyst upside, European contracts
- RKLB at $76.56: Above $61 target, up 55% monthly
- ASTS at $83.47: Extended, 91% volatility

**Question 3:** Is RDW the cleanest space entry or already late?

### AI Infrastructure Bounces
- SMCI at $31: 50% analyst upside, cleared accounting issues
- CRDO at $144: 57% analyst upside, 33% off highs

**Question 4:** Are these turnarounds or value traps?

### Squeeze Candidates
- APLD at $12-14: 30% short, AI spinoff
- RIVN at $15: 35-40% short, VW deal
- HIMS at $27: 30% short, GLP-1 + buyback

**Question 5:** Which squeeze has the cleanest trigger?

---

## THURSDAY JOBS REPORT CREATES BINARY RISK

**January 9, 8:30 AM ET:**
- Expected: +55-60K jobs (weak)
- Unemployment: 4.5% (vs 4.6% previous - 4yr high)
- Wage growth: +0.3% MoM

**The strategy suggests:** Enter Mon-Wed aggressively, cut 30-50% before Thursday open.

**Question 6:** Does this short time window favor momentum plays (CES/Nuclear) or squeeze setups (APLD/RIVN)?

---

## THE SCANNERS SAY

### Big Runner Scanner Results (Just Ran)
- Found 22 tickers with data
- Top scores: NNE (25/100 - 32% short), ARQQ (25/100 - low float)
- NO 70+ conviction plays found
- **Question:** Is the Big Runner criteria too strict for current market?

### CES Monitor Findings
- All high-priority CES plays already up 5-13%
- Entry window narrowing
- RR (Richtech) still below suggested entry ($3.86 vs $3.35-3.50 target)

### Known Insider Clusters (From Cluster Scanner)
- UUUU: 21 insiders (MASSIVE cluster)
- But stock already up 14.7% on Jan 2-3

## FENRIR'S ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

Use this structure to analyze each play:

### 1. CATALYST TIMING
- Is the catalyst BEFORE or AFTER the move?
- CES plays: Already up 5-13% → Are we late?
- Earnings: When do they report? (Check each)
- 8-K filings: Any recent contract news? (Run scanner)

### 2. TECHNICAL SETUP
- Is it breaking out or extended?
- Volume confirmation or low volume pump?
- Above or below key moving averages?

### 3. RISK/REWARD FOR PDT TRADER
- Can hold overnight (no day trade)
- Need 3-5% move minimum to justify risk
- Stop loss must be tight (-3% to -5%)
- Thursday morning exit window available

### 4. CROSS-VALIDATION
Check EACH candidate against our tools:
- [ ] Big Runner score (float, short interest, catalyst, position)
- [ ] CES Monitor (news, price action last 24h)
- [ ] Insider clusters (3+ insiders?)
- [ ] Wounded Prey score (if near lows)
- [ ] 8-K filings (any recent contracts?)
- [ ] Cross-Signal conviction score

## THE QUESTION FOR FENRIR

**Given:**
- $1,000 account (can only hold 2-3 positions max)
- PDT restricted (must swing, can't day trade)
- 3-day hold window (Mon-Wed before jobs report)
- Entries Monday open or first pullback
- Need conviction to survive volatility

**What is the HIGHEST CONVICTION play?**

**Your analysis must include:**

1. **The Pick** - ONE primary ticker
2. **Entry Zone** - Specific price levels
3. **Stop Loss** - Hard line in sand
4. **Target** - 3-day upside expectation
5. **Catalyst Timeline** - What moves it and when
6. **Risk Assessment** - What breaks the thesis
7. **Position Size** - % of $1,000 to risk
8. **Exit Strategy** - When to take profit / cut loss

**Compare at minimum:**
- RDW (space momentum)
- SMCI (AI turnaround)
- RR (CES robot + 26% short)
- QBTS (CES masterclass + 80% Monday win rate)
- RIVN (squeeze + VW catalyst)
- APLD (squeeze + AI spinoff)

**Use our scanner data to validate or invalidate each.**
