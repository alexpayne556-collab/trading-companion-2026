# 🐺 Welcome to The Wolf Pack - We Need You

## What This Is

A real trading system. Not a course. Not a signal service. Not finished.

We've built Wolf Pack v5.6 - a 7-signal convergence engine that:
- Hunts wounded prey (30%+ compression breakouts)
- Tracks institutional money (insider clusters)
- Learns from every trade (self-healing system)
- Enforces Market Wizards' wisdom (PTJ, Livermore, Kovner)

**Recent win:** IBRX $3.80 → $5.90+ (55% gain, still holding)

## What This Is NOT

- Get-rich-quick scheme
- Guaranteed profits
- Finished product
- Something you can just "run"

## What We Need

**Developers:** Python, APIs, automation  
**Traders:** Test theories, find edges, challenge assumptions  
**Researchers:** Study patterns, validate strategies  
**Data Scientists:** Analyze what works vs what doesn't

## Rules

1. **No hype** - We're building, not selling

4. **Show failures** - Learn in public
5. **Build together** - We're equals here

🐺 The pack is stronger than the wolf. The wolf is stronger because of the pack.

AWOOOO
