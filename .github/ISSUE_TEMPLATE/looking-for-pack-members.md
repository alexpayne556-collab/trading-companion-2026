## We're Building Something Real

Wolf Pack v5.6 is live. The code works. IBRX proves it ($3.80 → $5.90+, 55% gain).

But it's early. Lots to build. Lots to test. Lots to figure out.

## What We Need

### Developers
- Alpaca integration (paper → live trading)
- Real-time alerts
- Dashboard for monitoring
- API optimization

### Traders
- Test the system with paper accounts
- Challenge our assumptions
- Find new edges
- Document wins AND losses

### Researchers
- Validate theories (do pivotal points actually work?)
- Study Market Wizards' principles
- Analyze failed trades
- Find patterns we're missing

### Data Scientists
- Backtest validation
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning for pattern recognition
- Self-learning system improvements

## How to Contribute

1. Read [CODEBASE_MAP.md](https://github.com/alexpayne556-collab/the-wolf-pack-v1.1/blob/main/CODEBASE_MAP.md) - explains what's active vs old
2. Read [README.md](https://github.com/alexpayne556-collab/the-wolf-pack-v1.1/blob/main/README.md) - system overview
3. Pick something that interests you
4. Email: **alexpayne556@gmail.com**
   - Subject: `Wolf Pack - [Your Role] - Interested`
   - What you bring
   - What you want to work on

## Our Approach

We build each other up. We document failures. We do real work. We're equals.

## Current Status

✅ 7-signal convergence working  
✅ Market Wizards' wisdom integrated  
✅ Self-learning system built  
🟡 Alpaca automation (paper trading only)  
🟡 Daily monitoring needs improvement  
🔴 Live trading not ready yet

🐺 AWOOOO - The hunt begins together.
