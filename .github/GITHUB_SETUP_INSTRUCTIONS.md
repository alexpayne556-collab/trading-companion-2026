## What This Is

A real trading system. Not a course. Not a signal service. Not finished.

We've built Wolf Pack v5.6 - a 7-signal convergence engine that:
- Hunts wounded prey (30%+ compression breakouts)
- Tracks institutional money (insider clusters)
- Learns from every trade (self-healing system)
- Enforces Market Wizards' wisdom (PTJ, Livermore, Kovner)

**Recent win:** IBRX $3.80 → $5.90+ (55% gain, still holding)

## What This Is NOT

- Get-rich-quick scheme
- Guaranteed profits
- Finished product
- Something you can just "run"

## What We Need

**Developers:** Python, APIs, automation  
**Traders:** Test theories, find edges, challenge assumptions  
**Researchers:** Study patterns, validate strategies  
**Data Scientists:** Analyze what works vs what doesn't

## How to Join

Email: **alexpayne556@gmail.com**  
Subject: `Wolf Pack - [Your Role] - Interested`

Tell us:
- What you bring (skills, experience)
- What interests you (which part of the system)
- Why you care (not "to make money" - we all want that - why THIS approach?)

## What You'll Find Here

- Real code (some works, some doesn't)
- Real documentation (CODEBASE_MAP.md explains everything)
- Real failures (we document what DIDN'T work)
- Real wins (IBRX proves the pattern)

## Rules

1. **No hype** - We're building, not selling
2. **No ego** - Market doesn't care about your opinion
3. **Do work** - Ideas are cheap, execution matters
4. **Show failures** - Learn in public
5. **Build together** - We're equals here

🐺 The pack is stronger than the wolf. The wolf is stronger because of the pack.

AWOOOO

## We're Building Something Real

Wolf Pack v5.6 is live. The code works. IBRX proves it ($3.80 → $5.90+, 55% gain).

But it's early. Lots to build. Lots to test. Lots to figure out.

## What We Need

### Developers
- Alpaca integration (paper → live trading)
- Real-time alerts
- Dashboard for monitoring
- API optimization

### Traders
- Test the system with paper accounts
- Challenge our assumptions
- Find new edges
- Document wins AND losses

### Researchers
- Validate theories (do pivotal points actually work?)
- Study Market Wizards' principles
- Analyze failed trades
- Find patterns we're missing

### Data Scientists
- Backtest validation
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning for pattern recognition
- Self-learning system improvements

## How to Contribute

1. Read [CODEBASE_MAP.md](https://github.com/alexpayne556-collab/the-wolf-pack-v1.1/blob/main/CODEBASE_MAP.md) - explains what's active vs old
2. Read [README.md](https://github.com/alexpayne556-collab/the-wolf-pack-v1.1/blob/main/README.md) - system overview
3. Pick something that interests you
4. Email: **alexpayne556@gmail.com**
   - Subject: `Wolf Pack - [Your Role] - Interested`
   - What you bring
   - What you want to work on

## Our Approach

We build each other up. We document failures. We do real work. We're equals.

## Current Status

✅ 7-signal convergence working  
✅ Market Wizards' wisdom integrated  
✅ Self-learning system built  
🟡 Alpaca automation (paper trading only)  
🟡 Daily monitoring needs improvement  
🔴 Live trading not ready yet

Check [Issues](https://github.com/alexpayne556-collab/the-wolf-pack-v1.1/issues) for specific tasks.

🐺 AWOOOO - The hunt begins together.
```

## THAT'S IT

People will now see:
1. Your README (already there) with the system overview
2. Pinned welcome discussion explaining how to join
3. Pinned issue with specific roles needed

They'll email you at: **alexpayne556@gmail.com**

## What Happens Next

When people email:
- Read what they bring
- Check their GitHub profile (if they share it)
- Reply with: "Read CODEBASE_MAP.md, pick something that interests you, let's talk"

The repo does the selling. You just filter for people who want to build.

🐺 AWOOOO
