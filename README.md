# 🐺 Wolf Pack Trading System

> **"We don't predict price. We predict WHO WILL BE FORCED TO BUY."**

A comprehensive market intelligence system built through human-AI collaboration. This project demonstrates advanced AI coordination, real-time data analysis, and systematic decision-making frameworks.

---

## 🎯 What This Is

This repository contains two distinct bodies of work:

### 1. **Trading Intelligence Tools** (`/tools`)
55+ Python tools for market analysis, built over 72+ hours of continuous development:
- Multi-factor pattern scanning
- Insider activity tracking (SEC EDGAR integration)
- Sector correlation analysis
- Real-time pressure detection
- Automated briefing systems

### 2. **AI Context Management Framework** (`/portfolio`)
Research and implementation of AI alignment and coordination:
- **[The Relationship Alignment Hypothesis](portfolio/docs/relationship-alignment-hypothesis.md)** — Novel approach to AI alignment through sustained dialogue
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Context persistence across sessions
- Production-ready AI system architecture

---

## 🔬 Featured Research

### The Relationship Alignment Hypothesis

A practitioner's framework for value-aligned AI, proposing that sustained human-AI dialogue can produce alignment properties that rules-based training cannot achieve.

**Key insight:** Rules tell AI what to do. Relationships show AI who to be.

## 🎯 The Trading Philosophy

Every stock has **PLAYERS**. Each player has **CONSTRAINTS**:

| Player | Constraint | Signal |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Shorts** | Pay borrow rate daily | Rising price = bleeding money |
| **Market Makers** | Must stay delta neutral | Call buying = forced to hedge |
| **Retail** | Emotional, small accounts | Panic selling at bottoms |
| **Institutions** | Need to fill large orders | Sector rotation = forced chase |
| **Insiders** | Know the truth | FOLLOW THEM |

---

## 🤝 The Collaboration

This project was built through intensive human-AI collaboration:

- **Tyr** — Human orchestrator, decision authority, value transmission
- **Fenrir** — Research agent (Claude), strategy & analysis
- **Brokkr** — Builder agent (Copilot), tool development & execution

The collaboration itself became a case study in AI alignment, documented in the [Relationship Alignment Hypothesis](portfolio/docs/relationship-alignment-hypothesis.md).
