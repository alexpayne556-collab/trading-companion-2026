3. Which sectors typically "sell the news" after CES?
4. What are the rumored AI/chip announcements this year?
5. Any quantum computing companies presenting?
6. What autonomous vehicle demos are scheduled?

Give me specific tickers and dates to watch.
```

### PROMPT FOR DEEPSEEK:
```
Analyze historical CES stock performance patterns:

1. Take these tickers: NVDA, AMD, MU, QBTS, IONQ, LAZR, OUST
2. Look at price action from Dec 20 to Jan 15 for the past 3 years
3. What's the average move pre-CES vs post-CES?
4. Which names tend to pump before and dump after?
5. Which names actually hold gains?

I want to know: Should I buy before CES or wait for the post-event dip?
```

I need actionable intelligence on what to hold, what to add, what to cut.
```

### PROMPT FOR DEEPSEEK:
```
Historical analysis request:

Compare market performance in the first 30 days after:
- Trump's first inauguration (Jan 2017)
- Biden's inauguration (Jan 2021)

For these sectors:
- Defense/Aerospace
- Energy (traditional + nuclear)

## WAR GAME 1.4: Fed Meetings (January 29, March 19)

### PROMPT FOR PERPLEXITY:
```
The Federal Reserve meets January 28-29 and March 18-19, 2026.

Current context:
- What's the current Fed Funds rate?
- What are market expectations for rate changes in Q1?
- What economic data releases are scheduled before each meeting?

Questions:
1. What's the CME FedWatch probability for January and March?
2. What would make the Fed cut vs hold vs raise?
3. Which sectors benefit most from rate cuts? Rate holds?
4. How do small cap growth stocks (like my portfolio) typically react to Fed decisions?
5. What's the risk of a hawkish surprise?
6. When is the next CPI and jobs report before each meeting?

```
Historical Fed meeting analysis:

Look at the last 8 Fed meetings and analyze:
1. S&P 500 performance in the week before vs week after
2. Russell 2000 (small caps) performance same timeframe
3. Semiconductor sector (SMH) performance
4. Did "dovish" statements help or hurt growth stocks?
5. What's the typical volatility pattern around Fed meetings?

For my portfolio (small cap growth, semiconductors, speculative plays):
- Should I reduce exposure before Fed meetings?
- Or is the vol expansion an opportunity?
```

## WAR GAME 2.1: China-Taiwan Escalation

### PROMPT FOR PERPLEXITY:
```
Scenario: China announces military exercises around Taiwan in Q1 2026, causing a market selloff.

My exposure:
- MU (Micron) - memory chips, competes with Asian suppliers
- TSM (watching) - literally in Taiwan
- NIO - Chinese EV, ADR risk
- AI Oxygen thesis depends on chip supply chain

Questions:
1. What's the current status of China-Taiwan tensions?
2. Which U.S. semiconductor companies have the most Taiwan exposure?
3. If TSM production was disrupted, who benefits? (Intel? Samsung? GlobalFoundries?)
4. What happened to chip stocks during the last Taiwan Strait crisis?
5. How do Chinese ADRs (NIO, BABA, etc.) perform during US-China tension spikes?
6. What's the delisting risk timeline for Chinese ADRs?

I need to know: Is NIO a liability? Should I have a hedge?
```

### PROMPT FOR DEEPSEEK:
```
Scenario modeling:

Model a 10% probability "Taiwan crisis" event:
1. Which stocks in my watchlist would drop the most? (NVDA, AMD, MU, TSM, ASML, NIO)
2. Which would be relative safe havens? (domestic chip plays, defense, nuclear?)
3. What's the historical correlation between geopolitical VIX spikes and small cap growth?
4. How long did previous geopolitical selloffs last before recovery?
5. Would nuclear/energy stocks benefit from supply chain fears?

Give me a defensive playbook if this scenario starts developing.
```

## WAR GAME 2.2: Ukraine War Escalation or Resolution

### PROMPT FOR PERPLEXITY:
```
Two scenarios for Ukraine in Q1 2026:

SCENARIO A: Peace deal / ceasefire announced
SCENARIO B: Major escalation (NATO involvement, nuclear threat)

My positions: Defense stocks (SIDU, UMAC), watching nuclear (LEU, UEC)

Questions:
1. What's the current status of peace negotiations?
2. If a peace deal happens, what happens to defense stocks?
3. Would European defense stocks drop more than U.S. defense?
4. How would energy prices (oil, gas, uranium) react to each scenario?
5. Are drone/space defense companies (my holdings) more or less exposed than traditional defense (LMT, RTX)?
6. What happened to defense stocks when previous conflicts ended?

I need to know if my defense thesis survives peace.
```

## WAR GAME 2.3: Middle East Oil Shock

### PROMPT FOR PERPLEXITY:
```
Scenario: Iran conflict escalates, Strait of Hormuz shipping threatened, oil spikes to $120+

Questions:
1. What's the current Iran situation and risk level?
2. Which sectors get crushed by an oil spike? (airlines, transport, consumer discretionary?)
3. Which sectors benefit? (energy, tankers, nuclear as alternative?)
4. How do chip stocks perform during oil shocks? (they need energy to fab)
5. Would this accelerate or delay the nuclear/SMR buildout?
6. What's the historical correlation between oil price and small cap growth stocks?

I'm trying to understand if my portfolio has hidden oil exposure.
```

# SECTION 3: SECTOR-SPECIFIC SCENARIOS

---

## WAR GAME 3.1: AI Bubble Burst

### PROMPT FOR DEEPSEEK:
```
Devil's advocate scenario: The AI bubble pops in Q1 2026.

Trigger could be:
- A major AI company misses earnings badly
- AI revenue growth disappoints across the sector
- Regulatory crackdown on AI
- A major AI failure/scandal

My AI exposure: MU (memory), watching NVDA, AMD, AVGO, AI infrastructure plays

Questions:
1. What would be the early warning signs of an AI sentiment shift?
2. Which AI stocks are most overvalued and would fall hardest?
3. Would "AI infrastructure" (MU, ASML, power) fall as much as "AI application" stocks?
4. What's the bull case for why this WON'T happen in Q1?
5. If I see NVDA drop 20%, is that a buy or a sign to get out of everything?
6. What's the historical precedent? (dot-com bubble, crypto crashes)

I need to stress test my AI oxygen thesis. What kills it?
```

---

## WAR GAME 3.2: Nuclear Renaissance vs Nuclear Disaster

### PROMPT FOR PERPLEXITY:
```
I'm watching nuclear stocks: LEU, UEC, UUUU, OKLO, SMR, CCJ

Two scenarios:

SCENARIO A: Nuclear renaissance accelerates
- More tech company deals (Microsoft, Google, Amazon)
- Trump administration pro-nuclear policies
- SMR approvals accelerate

SCENARIO B: Nuclear setback
- An accident somewhere in the world
- Regulatory delays
- A major SMR project gets cancelled
- Cost overruns kill sentiment

Questions:
1. What nuclear catalysts are expected in Q1 2026?
2. Which stocks are most exposed to regulatory risk vs commodity (uranium) price?
3. Is LEU's HALEU monopoly defensible? What's the competition?
4. What would a Fukushima-level event do to these stocks? How long to recover?
5. Which nuclear stocks survived Three Mile Island and Fukushima best?
6. What's the realistic timeline for SMR revenue? Are these 2026 plays or 2030 plays?

I want to know: Is nuclear a Q1 trade or a long-term hold-and-wait?
```

---

## WAR GAME 3.3: Space/Defense Budget Fight

### PROMPT FOR PERPLEXITY:
```
I hold SIDU (space defense) and UMAC (drones).

Scenario: Congress fights over defense budget in Q1, threatens cuts or continuing resolution.

Questions:
1. What's the current defense budget status? Is FY2026 funded?
2. Which defense programs are most at risk from budget battles?
3. Are small space/drone contractors more or less vulnerable than big primes (LMT, RTX)?
4. What contracts has SIDU announced? Are they funded or pending?
5. What happened to small defense stocks during past budget crises?
6. Is the MDA (Missile Defense Agency) budget secure?

I need to know if my space defense thesis has political risk I'm not seeing.
```

```
I made money on KDK (Kodiak) and believe in autonomous trucking.

Two scenarios:

SCENARIO A: Breakthrough
- A major company achieves fully driverless at scale
- Regulatory approval expands
- Big partnership announcement

SCENARIO B: Setback
- Fatal accident involving autonomous truck
- Regulatory crackdown
- Major company exits the space (like TuSimple did)

Questions:
1. What's the current regulatory status for autonomous trucks?
2. Which states are most permissive? Which are blocking?
3. What's Aurora (AUR) doing vs Kodiak (KDK)? Who's ahead?
4. What happened to the sector after previous AV accidents?

## WAR GAME 4.1: My Holdings Stress Test

### PROMPT FOR DEEPSEEK:
```
Stress test my current portfolio:

Holdings:
- MU: 1 share @ $290.33 (AI memory thesis)
- SIDU: 20 shares @ $2.62 (space defense, MDA contract)
- UMAC: 2 shares @ $11.78 (drone defense)
- NIO: 15 shares @ $5.26 (Chinese EV momentum)
- CNMD: 2 shares @ $41.01 (Trump policy play)
- PALI: 15 shares @ $2.44 (momentum)

Run these scenarios:
1. Market drops 10% in a week - which of my holdings falls most/least?
2. Sector rotation from growth to value - impact on each position?
3. China ADR delisting news - impact on NIO and ripple effects?
4. Interest rates spike unexpectedly - which position hurts most?
5. My highest-conviction hold if I could only keep ONE?
6. My most vulnerable position I should consider cutting?

Be brutally honest. What's my weakest link?
```

## WAR GAME 4.2: The Perfect Q1 Storm

### PROMPT FOR DEEPSEEK:
```
Worst case Q1 2026:

- CES disappoints, tech sells off (Jan 7-10)
- Inauguration uncertainty spikes VIX (Jan 20)
- Fed holds rates, signals no cuts coming (Jan 29)
- China tensions rise over Taiwan
- AI earnings disappoint across the board (Feb)

For my portfolio (MU, SIDU, UMAC, NIO, CNMD, PALI) and watchlist (AI oxygen, nuclear, defense):

1. Model the cumulative damage - what am I down if all this hits?
2. Which of my positions survives best?
3. What should I be holding INSTEAD to weather this storm?
4. When would be the right time to buy the dip vs stay defensive?
5. What's my "panic sell everything" trigger point?
6. What cash allocation should I have going into January?

I have ~$235 cash. Should I deploy it now or save it for this potential storm?
```

---

## WAR GAME 4.3: The Perfect Q1 Bull Run

### PROMPT FOR DEEPSEEK:
```
Best case Q1 2026:

- CES brings massive AI announcements, tech rips
- Trump inauguration brings pro-business executive orders
- Fed signals cuts coming, dovish pivot
- AI earnings blow out expectations
- Nuclear deals accelerate
- Defense budget locked in

For my portfolio and watchlist:

1. Which of my current holdings would benefit most?
2. What should I ADD immediately if this plays out?
3. What's my realistic portfolio value if everything goes right?
4. Where should I take profits vs let winners run?
5. What would I regret NOT buying?
6. What's the "too good to be true" signal that the rally is overextended?

I want to have a plan for success, not just a plan for survival.
```

# SECTION 5: THE "WHAT'S NEXT" DISCOVERY

---

## WAR GAME 5.1: What Am I Missing?

### PROMPT FOR PERPLEXITY:
```
I'm a swing trader building a thesis-driven portfolio for 2026.

My current themes:
- AI Infrastructure (chips, memory, power, cooling)
- Nuclear/SMR renaissance
- Space defense
- Autonomous vehicles

What am I NOT seeing? What sectors or themes should I research that:
1. Are emerging in 2025 but will break out in 2026
2. Have catalysts in Q1 2026
3. Aren't crowded yet
4. Fit a small account swing trading style

Specifically interested in:
- Anything quantum-related beyond QBTS/IONQ
- Biotech themes I should watch
- Infrastructure plays (grid, construction, materials)
- Any "second derivative" plays (companies that benefit from the themes I'm already tracking)

Give me 10 tickers I should research that aren't on my radar yet.
```

---

## WAR GAME 5.2: What Kills Each Thesis?

### PROMPT FOR DEEPSEEK:
```
For each of my core investment themes, tell me what KILLS it:

1. AI OXYGEN THESIS (memory, compute, power are essential)
   - What makes this thesis wrong?
   - What's the bear case I'm ignoring?

2. NUCLEAR/SMR THESIS (AI needs power, nuclear is the answer)
   - What delays or kills this?
   - What's the realistic timeline I might be wrong about?

3. SPACE DEFENSE THESIS (MDA contracts, satellite defense)
   - What changes make this irrelevant?
   - What's the political risk?

4. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE THESIS (trucking, robotaxi)
   - What's the bear case?
   - Why might this take 10 years instead of 2?

I want the counter-argument to everything I believe. Make me question my assumptions.
```

---

## WAR GAME 5.3: 2026 Disruption Radar

### PROMPT FOR PERPLEXITY:
```
What technologies or trends could DISRUPT my current thesis in 2026?

I'm invested in:
- Memory chips (MU) - what replaces DRAM/HBM?
- GPU computing (watching NVDA) - what's the alternative architecture?
- Nuclear power - what makes it obsolete or unnecessary?
- Autonomous trucking - what's the competing solution?

Questions:
1. What's the latest on neuromorphic computing? Does it threaten traditional chips?
2. Is there a fusion energy breakthrough that changes the nuclear thesis?
3. What's happening with solid-state batteries and energy storage?
4. Any AI breakthroughs that reduce compute requirements?
5. What's China developing that could leapfrog U.S. tech?
6. What did I miss from the last 90 days of tech news?

I want to know what could make my entire watchlist obsolete.
```
