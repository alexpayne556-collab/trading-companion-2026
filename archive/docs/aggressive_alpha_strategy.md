# AGGRESSIVE ALPHA STRATEGY
## No Fear. Maximum Conviction. Built to 10X.

---

**MINDSET SHIFT:**

❌ SURVIVAL MODE: "Don't lose money"
✅ THRIVE MODE: "Capture the big moves"

❌ SCARED: "What if it drops?"
✅ AGGRESSIVE: "What if it doubles?"

❌ DIVERSIFIED: 10 positions, 10% each
✅ CONCENTRATED: 3-4 positions, MAXIMUM CONVICTION

# THE MATH OF WINNING BIG

Why Concentration Beats Diversification for Small Accounts

SCARED PORTFOLIO ($1,500 split 6 ways):
- 6 positions × $250 each
- One doubles (+$250), others flat
- Total return: +17%
- You made: $250
- TIME WASTED: Could have made more

AGGRESSIVE PORTFOLIO ($1,500 concentrated):
- 2-3 positions × $500-750 each
- One doubles (+$500-750)
- Total return: +33-50%
- You made: $500-750
- THAT'S HOW YOU COMPOUND

**THE TRUTH:** With $1,500, you need CONCENTRATED BETS on HIGH CONVICTION plays.

# AGGRESSIVE RULES (Different from Defensive)

## ENTRIES
- Buy when thesis is RIGHT, not when price is "safe"
- Average UP into winners
- Add when stock proves you right
- Size up on highest conviction

## STOPS (Still Required - But Strategic)
- Stop at -25% (wider)
- Give positions room
- Exit if thesis breaks
- RCAT stop: $6.00, DNN: $1.50, SEALSQ: $3.00, RGTI: $6.00

## PROFIT TAKING (Let Winners Run)
- First trim at +50% (sell 25%)
- Second trim at +100% (sell 25%)
- Let 50% ride
- Trail stop at -30% from high

## CONCENTRATION
- 3-4 positions MAX
- 25-40% per position
- Know each position DEEPLY
- Follow every piece of news

---

# THE MENTAL GAME

What Winners Think:
- "Is my thesis still valid? Yes? Then hold."
- "This is working. Let it run. Trim small."
- "Is my thesis broken? No? Buy the dip."
- "I did the work. I know more than them."

Big Winners:
- Will NOT go straight up
- Will drop 20-30% multiple times
- Will test your conviction
- Buy, hold, and sell only when thesis breaks
