# TRADING WAR GAME SYSTEM (2026)
## Pre-Trade Scenario Analysis & Sector/Ticker Resilience
# Source: User's war game framework, December 2025

## THE CONCEPT
Before every trade, WAR GAME it: "What are ALL the possible outcomes, and what do I do in EACH scenario?" This eliminates emotion and prepares you for every outcome.

## THE 6 SCENARIOS (Every Trade)
1. PERFECT TRADE: Price goes straight to target. Full profit.
2. MESSY WIN: Price chops, tests stop, then hits target. Stressful, but profit.
3. PARTIAL WIN: Price hits first target, reverses. Partial profit.
4. BREAKEVEN: Price up, stop moved to breakeven, reverses. No gain/loss.
5. SMALL LOSS: Stop hit, planned loss. Accept and move on.
6. BLACK SWAN: Gap down/news bomb, loss bigger than planned. Sell at open.

## WAR GAME TEMPLATE (Fill Before Every Trade)

B. Gridlock: Quality companies win

E. AI bubble pops: Cash, non-tech value stocks win

## SECTOR ALLOCATION BASED ON SCENARIOS
- DEFENSE: Heavy allocation (wins in most scenarios)

- AI INFRA: Medium allocation
- QUANTUM: Medium allocation
- SPACE: Medium allocation
- CASH RESERVE: Always keep 20-30% for risk-off

TIER 2: SMR, UEC, IONQ (high upside, moderate risk)
TIER 3: ASTS, RGTI, OKLO (highest risk/reward)

## MISSION CONTROL CENTER (Layout 5)
- Track positions, entry, P&L, stop status
