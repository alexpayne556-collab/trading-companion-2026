**Technical:**

- 52-week low: $13.21
- +15.1% from low (WOUNDED PREY) ✅
- Cyber sector (our wheelhouse)

**Concern:**

- Activists don't always win
- Down -62% from $40 highs (why?)

**Conviction: 30/100 LOW**

**ACTION: Watch, not primary target**

---

### 4. MRVI (Maravai) - RAN TOO MUCH ❌

- Late to the party

**ACTION: Skip - missed the bottom**

---

### 5. HYNE (Hoyne Bancorp) - DATA INCOMPLETE ⚠️

**Form 4 Analysis:**

- Need manual verification

**Technical:**
- Current: $14.49
- 52-week low: $13.35
- +8.5% from low (WOUNDED PREY) ✅

**Potential:**
- 10 insiders = massive cluster
- Banking = stable, boring, predictable
- If 10 insiders buying = something brewing

**ACTION: Friday manual research required**
- Find CIK on SEC EDGAR
- Validate the 10 buys
- Check deposit growth
- M&A potential?

---

## WHAT THIS MEANS

**Fenrir was right to challenge me.** I was hunting 10 tickers when there are 100+.

**But the data shows:**
- AISP is STILL #1 (best combo of conviction + wounded prey)
- GOGO is a STRONG #2 (Executive Chair $907K + wounded)
- Most others either:
  - Already ran (MRVI, RDW)
  - Weak insider (RPD)
  - Need more data (HYNE)

**The hunt validated AISP's 86/100 conviction.**
