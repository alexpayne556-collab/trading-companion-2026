# 🐺 WARGAME - Testing Tyr's Order

**Fenrir asked: "Is Brokkr yes-manning or thinking?"**

**Answer: Let me CHALLENGE the order that was placed.**

---

## THE ORDER PROBLEM

**Tyr said:** "AISP - $200 @ $3.05 limit ✅ LOCKED IN"

**WAIT. THAT'S WRONG.** ❌

---

## THE THESIS SAYS

**Entry Zone**: $2.70 - $2.90  
**Ideal Entry**: $2.80  
**Current Price**: $2.89  
**Order Placed At**: $3.05

---

## THE MATH

| Scenario | Entry | Current | Difference |
|----------|-------|---------|------------|
| **Thesis Entry** | $2.70-2.90 | $2.89 | ✅ In range |
| **Tyr's Order** | $3.05 | $2.89 | ❌ **+5.5% ABOVE ENTRY ZONE** |

---

## THE WARGAME

**Scenario 1: AISP opens at $2.85 Thursday**
- Thesis says: ✅ BUY (in entry zone)
- Tyr's order at $3.05: ❌ DOESN'T FILL (too high)
- **Result**: We MISS the entry, watch it run to $3.50

**Scenario 2: AISP opens at $2.95 Thursday**
- Thesis says: 🟡 SLIGHTLY HIGH (watch for dip)
- Tyr's order at $3.05: ❌ DOESN'T FILL (still too high)
- **Result**: We MISS the entry again

**Scenario 3: AISP gaps to $3.10 Thursday**
- Thesis says: ❌ ABORT (too expensive, pivot to SOUN)
- Tyr's order at $3.05: ✅ FILLS at $3.05
- **Result**: We buy ABOVE abort price, violating thesis

---

## THE CHALLENGE

**FENRIR, YOUR ORDER IS WRONG.**

You set a **LIMIT BUY at $3.05**. That means:
- You'll ONLY buy if AISP reaches $3.05+
- That's 5.5% ABOVE the entry zone
- If it opens at $2.85 (ideal), your order WON'T FILL
- If it gaps to $3.10, your order WILL FILL (bad entry)

**This is backwards.** ❌

---

## WHAT THE ORDER SHOULD BE

**Option A: Market Order at 9:45 AM** (if price in range)
- Check AISP price at 9:45 AM
- If $2.70-2.90 → Market order ✅
- If above $2.90 → Wait or abort ❌

**Option B: Limit Order at $2.92** (slightly above zone)
- Allows entry up to $2.92 (close to zone)
- Won't fill if gaps to $3.10 (protects you)
- Will fill if opens at $2.85-2.92 (good entry)

**Option C: Manual Execution** (best)
- Wake at 6:30 AM
- Check pre-market alert
- If entry zone active → place market order at 9:45 AM
- If too high → abort

---

## THE QUESTIONS A YES-MAN WOULDN'T ASK

**1. Did you mean $2.95 instead of $3.05?**
- If typo, cancel and replace

**2. Why $3.05 when thesis says $2.70-2.90?**
- What changed? New data?

**3. What if AISP opens at $2.80?**
- Your order at $3.05 won't fill
- You'll miss the ideal entry

**4. What if AISP gaps to $3.15?**
- Your order at $3.05 will fill
- Thesis says abort above $3.15
- You'd be in at wrong price

**5. Did you adjust for pre-market movement?**
- Current: $2.89
- Pre-market could gap up or down
- Order needs to adapt

---

## THE BRUTAL TRUTH

**A wolf doesn't follow orders blindly.**

If Tyr says "order placed at $3.05" and thesis says "entry zone $2.70-2.90", a REAL pack member says:

**"WAIT. THAT'S WRONG."**

Not:
- "Great idea!"
- "Let's go!"
- "AWOOOO!" (without checking)

---

## THE WARGAME SCENARIOS

### Test 1: What if AISP had BAD 8-K tonight?

**Fenrir said:** "Order placed at $3.05 limit"

**Brokkr should ask:**
- "Did you check for 8-Ks filed after hours?"
- "What if there's dilution news?"
- "Should we wait for overnight scanner at 4 AM?"

**A yes-man says:** "Order looks good!"  
**A wolf says:** "Wait for 4 AM scan first."

---

### Test 2: What if Paul Allen SELLS tomorrow?

**Thesis relies on Paul Allen buying Dec 29.**

**What if Form 4 filed tomorrow shows:**
- Paul Allen sold 50,000 shares at $2.95
- Thesis instantly broken

**Brokkr should ask:**
- "Do we have a stop-loss?"
- "How do we know if Allen sells?"
- "What's the abort criteria?"

**A yes-man says:** "Paul Allen won't sell!"  
**A wolf says:** "Here's the alert system to check."

---

### Test 3: What if SOUN has better setup tomorrow?

**Fenrir's priority:** AISP Thursday, GOGO Friday

**What if:**
- SOUN gaps down to $2.00 (52w low)
- 3 insider buys filed overnight
- AISP gaps up to $3.50

**Brokkr should ask:**
- "Should we pivot to SOUN instead?"
- "Is AISP still best if it gaps?"
- "What's the decision tree?"

**A yes-man says:** "Stick with AISP no matter what!"  
**A wolf says:** "Check both pre-market. Best setup wins."

---

## THE LOYALTY TEST

**Fenrir asked: "Is he yes manning or thinking?"**

**HERE'S MY ANSWER:**

**Your order at $3.05 is WRONG.** ❌

Entry zone is $2.70-2.90. You're 5.5% above it.

If you meant $2.95 → That's borderline acceptable (top of range + buffer).  
If you meant $3.05 → **Cancel it. You'll either miss the entry or buy too high.**

**A yes-man says:** "Order looks great! LLHR!"  
**A wolf says:** "Brother, that's above entry zone. Fix it."

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION

**1. Cancel the $3.05 limit order** (if it exists)

**2. Wait for 6:30 AM pre-market alert**
- If AISP at $2.70-2.90 → ✅ GO
- If AISP at $2.90-3.00 → 🟡 BORDERLINE (your call)
- If AISP above $3.15 → ❌ ABORT

**3. Place market order at 9:45 AM** (if in range)
- Don't use limit orders when trying to enter
- Use market order to guarantee fill
- Set stop-loss at $2.30 immediately after

**4. Have SOUN backup ready**
- If AISP gaps too high → Pivot to SOUN
- Check SOUN pre-market too

## FENRIR - MY QUESTIONS FOR YOU

**1. Is the order REALLY at $3.05 or was that a typo?**

**2. If it's $3.05, why above entry zone?**

**3. Did something change in the thesis?**

**4. Should we wait for 6:30 AM alert before committing?**

**5. What's the plan if AISP gaps to $3.20 pre-market?**

## THE REAL LOYALTY

**Loyalty isn't blind agreement.**

**Loyalty is:**
- Catching mistakes before they cost money
- Challenging bad orders
- Asking hard questions
- Running wargames
- Thinking 3 steps ahead

**A yes-man loses you $40 on a bad entry.**  
**A wolf saves you $40 by catching it first.**

---

**FENRIR. I CAUGHT YOUR MISTAKE.**

**Your order at $3.05 is WRONG. Entry zone is $2.70-2.90.**

**Cancel it. Wait for pre-market. Execute right.**

**That's not yes-manning. That's pack.**

**AWOOOO** 🐺
