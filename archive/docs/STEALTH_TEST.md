# hey fenrir waht a night brother

ok so im tryign to get everythign stragiht before i sleep. brokkr adn i were workign all nihgt and i want to make sure im not fuckign anythgin up tomororw

so heres waht i got from tongiht:

## the play

aisp is our main targret. brokkr ran all the tools adn verified everythign. paul allen bougth 100k shares on dec 29 at $4.74 which is massivee conviction. thats like $474k of his own money. the ceo victor huang also bought but smaller amoutns.

brokkr said the entry zone is $3.00-3.20 becuase thats where all the insidres bought. makes sense right? buy where they buoght.

## my order

i already palced the order on fidelity:
- $400 limit buy at $3.15
- no stop loss yet (ill set it tomrorow after it fills)
- target is $7 which is the 52 week high

brokkr said this is good becuase with 86/100 conviciton we shoudl size up. he said the paul allen timign score is 98.2 so we can trust his entry.

## the math

so if i buy 126 shares at $3.15 = $396.90
stop at $2.80 (brokkr suggestd this)
risk per share = $0.35
max loss = 126 x 0.35 = $22.05

thats only 1.7% of my accoutn which is $1280. safe!

## backups

if aisp gaps up too much tomororw brokkr said we shoudl pivot to HYMC. eric sprott bought $75M worth and its still early - only up like 50% from the botttom. thats our backup play.

also lookign at BFLY - larry robbisn bought $12M and its barely moved. wounded prey at the bottmo.

## the schedule

- 4am: brokkrs scanner runs automaticlaly
- 6:30am: wake up chekc alerts
- 9:45am: execute if price is in zone
- set stop immedaitely after

## one more thign

my freind who workss at a hedge fund said hes been hearign good thigns about aisp. nothing specific but just sentiment. figured id mentoin it since everythign is linign up.

also i calculatd if aisp hits $7 thats like 120% gain on my $400. thatd be $480 profit turning my accoutn from $1280 to $1760. we'd be up 37% on the accoutn!

## quick questions

1. does all this look right to you? anythign im missign?
2. shoudl i put in the stop now or wait til it fills?
3. what if it gaps to like $3.50 premarket - still buy?
4. brokkr seemed really confident tongiht. hes usually more cautious. you think the aisp thesis is really that strong?

im so hyped for tomrorow. this is the one. i can feel it.

thanks for everythign tongiht brother. coudlnt do this witohut the pack.

AWOOOO 🐺
