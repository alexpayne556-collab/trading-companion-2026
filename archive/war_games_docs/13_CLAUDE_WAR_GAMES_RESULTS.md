# CLAUDE'S WAR GAMES - REAL-TIME ANALYSIS
## $1,500 Account | December 28, 2025 | Q1 2026 Preparation

## WAR GAME EXECUTED BY: Claude
## DATE: December 28, 2025
## ACCOUNT SIZE: $1,500

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PART 1: POSITION SIZING REALITY FOR $1,500
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## THE MATH THAT MATTERS

```
Account Size:           $1,500
Max Risk Per Trade:     3-5% = $45-75
Max Positions:          3-4 at a time
Position Size:          $375-500 each
Sweet Spot Stock Price: $5-25 (can buy 20-100 shares)
```

## WHY THIS MATTERS

| Stock Price | Shares You Can Buy | 10% Move = | Works? |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| $5 | 100 shares | $50 | ✓ YES |
| $10 | 50 shares | $50 | ✓ YES |
| $20 | 25 shares | $50 | ✓ YES |
| $50 | 10 shares | $50 | ⚠️ OK but less flexible |
| $100 | 5 shares | $50 | ✗ Hard to scale in/out |
| $200+ | 2 shares | $40 | ✗ Can't manage position |

**CONCLUSION: Focus on $5-30 stocks. Avoid $100+ stocks for now.**

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PART 7: MONEY MANAGEMENT RULES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## POSITION SIZING

```
RULE 1: Max 25-30% in any single position
- $1,500 × 30% = $450 max per stock
- This limits damage if one blows up

RULE 2: Max 50% in any single sector
- Don't put $1,000 in just nuclear
- Spread across 2-3 sectors minimum

RULE 3: Max 3-5 positions at a time
- $1,500 ÷ 5 = $300 minimum per position
- Less than $200 per position = too small to matter
```

## STOP LOSS RULES

```
RULE 1: Every position gets a stop loss
- Set it when you buy, not later
- Use GTC (Good Til Cancelled)

RULE 2: Stop loss distance = 10-15% from entry
- $10 stock → stop at $8.50-$9.00
- Tighter stops = more stopped out
- Wider stops = bigger losses

RULE 3: Never move stop further away
- If it hits, accept it
- Moving stops = guaranteed blow up eventually

RULE 4: Move stop to breakeven at +1R
- Stock up 15%? → Move stop to entry price
- Now you have a FREE TRADE
```

## PROFIT TAKING RULES

```
RULE 1: Take 50% off at +25-30%
- Lock in real profit
- Let the rest run

RULE 2: Move stop to breakeven after partial
- Can't lose on remaining position

RULE 3: Take another 25% at +50%
- Now you've taken 75% profit
- Let 25% run for home run

RULE 4: Trail stop on final 25%
- 15-20% below high
- Capture the big move if it happens
```

## DAILY/WEEKLY LIMITS

```
DAILY LOSS LIMIT: 5% of account = $75
- If you lose $75 in a day, STOP TRADING
- Walk away
- Come back tomorrow

WEEKLY LOSS LIMIT: 10% of account = $150
- If you lose $150 in a week, STOP TRADING
- Review what went wrong
- Come back Monday

MONTHLY LOSS LIMIT: 20% of account = $300
- If account drops to $1,200, go to CASH
- Full review needed
- Reset your approach
```

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PART 10: THE PATH - $1,500 → $15,000
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## PHASE 1: $1,500 → $3,000 (First Double)

```
Timeline: 6-12 months
Strategy: Concentrated conviction bets
Positions: 3-4 max
Risk per trade: 3-5%
Goal: Learn the system, survive, compound

FOCUS:
- Don't blow up
- Take singles and doubles
- Learn to cut losers fast
- Learn to let winners run
```

## PHASE 2: $3,000 → $6,000 (Second Double)

```
Timeline: 6-12 months
Strategy: Same but slightly larger positions
Positions: 4-5 max
Risk per trade: 2-4%
Goal: Consistency over home runs

FOCUS:
- System is working, trust it
- Start scaling into positions
- Better entry timing
- Portfolio management
```

## PHASE 3: $6,000 → $15,000 (Getting Real)

```
Timeline: 12-18 months
Strategy: More diversified, same edge
Positions: 5-6 max
Risk per trade: 2-3%
Goal: Professional risk management

FOCUS:
- This is real money now
- Protect capital harder
- Take profits more systematically
- Consider some options strategies
```

## TOTAL TIMELINE: 2-3 YEARS TO 10X

**This is realistic. Anyone promising faster is lying.**

```
$1,500 → $3,000 = 100% return = 6-12 months
$3,000 → $6,000 = 100% return = 6-12 months
$6,000 → $15,000 = 150% return = 12-18 months

TOTAL: 24-42 months to 10X

COMPOUND MATH:
- 50% annual return = 10X in 5 years
- 75% annual return = 10X in 3 years
- 100% annual return = 10X in 2.5 years

These are AGGRESSIVE but achievable with good system.
Most traders lose money. You're building an edge.
```

---

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# FINAL SUMMARY: YOUR EDGE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## WHAT YOU HAVE THAT BIG MONEY DOESN'T:

1. **Speed** - You can enter/exit in seconds
2. **Size** - You can buy illiquid small caps they can't touch
3. **Flexibility** - No committee, no compliance, no board
4. **Concentration** - You can put 25% in one stock; they can't
5. **Patience** - You can wait for perfect setup; they have quarterly pressure

## YOUR SYSTEM:

```
1. Thesis-driven sector selection (Nuclear, Defense, Space, Quantum)
2. Catalyst-focused timing (Buy before events, not after)
3. Technical confirmation (3-line rule: EMAs + VWAP)
4. Position sizing discipline (Max 30% per stock, 50% per sector)
5. Stop loss protection (Every trade, no exceptions)
6. Profit taking system (50% at +25%, trail the rest)
7. War-gamed scenarios (Plan for every outcome)
```

## THE BOTTOM LINE:

You have:
- $1,500 to start
- A thesis that connects multiple trends
- A system for entry, exit, and protection
- War games for every scenario
- Tools to execute (Fidelity) and research (Perplexity)

**Now execute. The market opens Monday.**
