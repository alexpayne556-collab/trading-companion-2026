# SECTION 6: RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## POSITION SIZING RULES

```
RULE 1: Max 30% in single position = $450
RULE 2: Max 50% in single sector = $750
RULE 3: Max 3 correlated positions (e.g., 3 uranium stocks)
RULE 4: Min position size = $200 (smaller = not worth it)
RULE 5: Max 5 positions total at any time
```

## STOP LOSS FRAMEWORK

```
DEFAULT STOP: -15% to -20% from entry
- $10 stock = stop at $8.00-$8.50
- Set at SUPPORT levels, not random %

TIGHTEN STOPS WHEN:
- Up 25%+ (move to breakeven)
- Up 50%+ (move to +25%)
- Thesis weakening (tighter stop)

NEVER:
- Move stop FURTHER from entry
- Remove stop entirely
- "Hope" it comes back
```

## PROFIT TAKING FRAMEWORK

```
FIRST PARTIAL: Sell 33% at +30%
SECOND PARTIAL: Sell 33% at +50%
FINAL: Trail stop 20% below high, let it run

EXAMPLE:
- Buy RCAT at $8.00 (50 shares = $400)
- Sell 17 shares at $10.40 (+30%) = $177
- Sell 17 shares at $12.00 (+50%) = $204
- Hold 16 shares with stop at 20% below high
- If runs to $16, stop at $12.80
```

## DRAWDOWN MANAGEMENT

```
DAILY LOSS LIMIT: -$75 (5% of account)
→ If hit: Stop trading today. Full stop.

WEEKLY LOSS LIMIT: -$150 (10% of account)
→ If hit: Stop trading this week. Review everything.

MONTHLY LOSS LIMIT: -$300 (20% of account)
→ If hit: Go 100% cash. Full strategy review.

RECOVERY RULES:
- After daily limit: Next day trade half size
- After weekly limit: Next week trade half size
- After monthly limit: Paper trade for 2 weeks
```

## SCENARIO-BASED ADJUSTMENTS

```
IF VIX > 25:
→ Reduce position sizes by 25%
→ Tighten stops to -10%
→ No new positions

IF VIX > 35:
→ Reduce position sizes by 50%
→ Consider going to cash
→ Only defense positions

IF SPY BREAKS 200-DAY MA:
→ Reduce to 50% invested
→ Move to defensive names only
→ Raise more cash

IF IWM BREAKS 200-DAY MA FOR 5+ DAYS:
→ Small caps in trouble
→ Reduce all positions
→ Consider large cap hedges

IF YOUR THESIS BREAKS:
→ Exit ALL related positions
→ Reassess from scratch
→ Don't fight the tape
```
