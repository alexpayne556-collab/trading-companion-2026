## CURRENT PRICE: $8.30
## 52-WEEK: $4.58 - $16.70
## MARKET CAP: $990M

### SEC/INSIDER INTELLIGENCE:

**INSIDER SELLING (CAUTION FLAG):**
- Director Joseph Freedman sold 150,000 shares at $7.37 in June 2025
- Exercised options at $2.51, sold at $7.37 = took profit
- This is NORMAL profit-taking, not panic selling

**CAPITAL RAISES:**
- $46.75M raised in June 2025 at $7.25/share
- $150M public offering in September 2025
- **BULLISH:** Company raising capital to GROW, not survive

### OPTIONS FLOW INTELLIGENCE:

**PUT/CALL RATIO: 0.27** (Very Bullish)
- Ratio under 1.0 = more calls than puts
- 0.27 = EXTREMELY bullish positioning
- Institutions betting on UPSIDE

**UNUSUAL OPTIONS ACTIVITY:**
- 36,532 contracts vs 159,526 open interest
- Call volume: 22,424 (bullish)
- Put volume: 14,108 (hedging)

### ANALYST RATINGS:

- **Needham:** BUY rating (Oct 2025, maintained Nov 2025)
- **Average Price Target:** $12-15

⚠️ Still unprofitable company
⚠️ High short interest

### TECHNICAL PICTURE:

- Pulled back from $16.70 high to $8.30 (-50%)
- Found support around $8
- Statistical analysis: When RCAT falls 10-20% weekly, 57% chance of +12.9% gain in next month

### VERDICT: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ STRONG BUY

**WHY:** 
- FCC catalyst JUST hit (Dec 23)
- Put/call ratio extremely bullish (0.27)
- Analyst targets 45-80% higher
- Blue UAS mandate = guaranteed market
