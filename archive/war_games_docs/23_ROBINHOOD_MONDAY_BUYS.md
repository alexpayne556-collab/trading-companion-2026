# ⚠️ KEY INSIGHT FROM PRICES:

**QBTS has run HARD** - $25 now vs $6 a few weeks ago
**RGTI has run HARD** - Was $8, now closer to $10
**These had their Q4 run. Careful chasing.**

**BETTER ENTRY OPPORTUNITIES:**
- **RCAT** at $8.30 - pulled back from $16, still has upside
- **DNN** at $2.20 - cheap, massive leverage to uranium
- **BBAI** at $5.73 - defense AI, not yet exploded
- **LAES/SEALSQ** at $4 - post-quantum security, volatile

# 🚨 WHAT TO BUY FIRST (Priority Order)

## TIER 1: BUY MONDAY MORNING
**These have the best risk/reward RIGHT NOW:**

### 1. RCAT - $8.30

# 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION FOR MONDAY

**If I had $1,000 to deploy RIGHT NOW:**

```
RCAT:  $400 = 48 shares @ $8.30
DNN:   $350 = 159 shares @ $2.20  
BBAI:  $250 = 43 shares @ $5.73
─────────────────────────────────
TOTAL: $1,000

WHY THIS MIX:
- RCAT = Defense drones, immediate catalyst (FCC ruling)
- DNN  = Uranium leverage, cheap entry, AI power thesis
- BBAI = Defense AI, hasn't run yet, Trump catalyst

ALL THREE have catalysts in Q1 2026.
ALL THREE are in your price range.
NONE have already 10X'd this year.
```

# ⚠️ RULES FOR MONDAY
