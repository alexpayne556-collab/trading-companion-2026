## THE BIG PICTURE: The 2026 Transformation

We are living through multiple simultaneous transformations:

1. **AI is consuming everything** - But AI needs power, cooling, chips
2. **The world is getting more dangerous** - Defense spending is rising globally
3. **Energy is being reinvented** - Nuclear is the only scalable solution
4. **New technologies are leaving the lab** - Quantum, robotics, biotech
5. **Space is becoming infrastructure** - Not just exploration anymore

**Your edge:** You understand these transformations are connected. Most traders don't.

## HOW TO USE THIS THESIS

### STEP 1: KNOW THE NARRATIVE
- Before trading any ticker, know WHY it should go up
- "Defense spending increasing" is your narrative for RCAT, KTOS, etc.
- "AI needs nuclear power" is your narrative for SMR, UEC, etc.

### STEP 2: PRIORITIZE BY CATALYST
- What events are coming in the next 30-60 days?
- Position BEFORE catalysts, not after
- Check the catalyst calendar regularly

### STEP 3: CONCENTRATE ON CONVICTION
- Your top 3 sectors should get 80% of your attention
- Don't spread too thin across 8 sectors
- Pick the ones with the nearest/biggest catalysts

### STEP 4: MATCH THESIS TO TECHNICALS
- Great thesis + bad chart = WAIT
- Good thesis + good chart = TRADE
- No thesis + good chart = SKIP (you have enough good ideas)
