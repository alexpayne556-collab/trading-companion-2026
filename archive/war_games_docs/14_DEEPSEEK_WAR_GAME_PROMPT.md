This is WAR GAMES for real money. I need:
- SPECIFIC tickers with SPECIFIC prices
- SPECIFIC scenarios with SPECIFIC probabilities  
- SPECIFIC actions for SPECIFIC situations
- NO generic advice - only actionable intelligence

Execute comprehensive analysis. Show your work. Challenge assumptions. Find what others miss.

BEGIN WAR GAMES.

## DEEPSEEK USAGE NOTES:

1. DeepSeek may be more thorough than Perplexity on analysis
2. If it truncates, ask "Continue from Section X"
3. Compare DeepSeek output to Perplexity output
4. Compare both to my war games
5. Synthesize the BEST intelligence from all three

---

## WHAT WE'RE TESTING:

- Does DeepSeek understand small account constraints better?
- Does DeepSeek give more realistic probabilities?
- Does DeepSeek find tickers Perplexity missed?
- Does DeepSeek challenge our thesis or confirm it?

---

*Run this. Show me what DeepSeek returns. We compare all intelligence sources and build the ultimate system.*
