# LAYOUT 1: THE RADAR
## Finding What's Moving Before It Fully Moves

---

## PURPOSE OF THIS LAYOUT

Layout 1 answers ONE question: **"Where is money flowing RIGHT NOW?"**

You spend 2-3 minutes here to identify:
1. Is the overall market bullish or bearish today?
2. Which of YOUR sectors are hot?
3. Which specific tickers are showing unusual activity?
4. Are there any news catalysts?

**You do NOT trade from this layout. You only SCAN.**

## STEP-BY-STEP BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: Create a New Layout

1. In Fidelity Trader Pro, look at the top left
2. You should see layout tabs or a layout dropdown
3. Click to create a new layout OR use an existing empty one
4. We'll name it "L1 - Radar" at the end

### STEP 2: Add the Heatmap (Your Sector Scanner)

1. Click **Tools** in the top menu bar
2. Click **Watchlist**
3. A watchlist window opens
4. Position it on the LEFT side of your screen (drag the edges to make it about 60% of screen width)
5. At the top of the watchlist, you'll see tabs or buttons for "Watchlist" and "Heatmap"
6. Click **Heatmap**
7. Load one of your sector watchlists (like TOP_30_EMERGING or DEFENSE_DISRUPTION)

**Heatmap Settings:**
- Sort by: $ Change (shows biggest movers)
- Color by: % Change (green = up, red = down)

**How to Read the Heatmap:**
- BIG GREEN boxes = up a lot on high volume (LOOK AT THESE)
- Small green boxes = up but not much volume
- BIG RED boxes = down a lot on high volume (avoid or potential short)
- Small red boxes = down but not significant

### STEP 3: Add Market Indices Watchlist

1. Click **Tools** → **Watchlist** again
2. A second watchlist window opens
3. Position it on the TOP RIGHT (about 20% of screen)
4. Keep it in LIST view (not heatmap)
5. Manually add these symbols:
   - SPY (S&P 500 ETF - overall market)
   - QQQ (Nasdaq 100 ETF - tech-heavy market)
   - IWM (Russell 2000 ETF - small caps, YOUR stocks)
   - VIX (Volatility Index - fear gauge)

**Add These Columns:**
- Symbol
- Last
- % Chg

**How to Read Market Indices:**

| SPY | QQQ | IWM | What It Means |
|-----|-----|-----|---------------|
| Green | Green | Green | Strong bull day, be aggressive |
| Green | Green | Red | Big caps up, small caps weak - be cautious |
| Red | Red | Green | Rotation to small caps - YOUR stocks may shine |
| Red | Red | Red | Risk-off day, be defensive or sit out |

| VIX Level | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| Below 15 | Very calm, complacent market |
| 15-20 | Normal market conditions |
| 20-25 | Elevated fear, more volatile |
| Above 25 | High fear, expect big swings |
| Above 30 | Panic mode, be very careful |

### STEP 4: Add News Panel

1. Click **Tools** → **News**
2. Position it on the BOTTOM portion of your screen (or right side)
3. Make it about 40% of screen width
4. Click the settings/filter icon in the News panel
5. Filter to: **"Watchlist Symbols"** or your specific watchlists
6. Sort by: **Most Recent**

**What You're Looking For in News:**
- Contract awards ("Company X wins $50M Army contract")
- Earnings announcements
- FDA approvals or regulatory decisions
- Analyst upgrades/downgrades
- Sector-wide news (defense spending bill, nuclear policy, etc.)

**News + Price Move = CATALYST CONFIRMED**

### STEP 5: Save the Layout

1. Click on the layout menu (usually top left)
2. Click "Save Layout" or "Save As"
3. Name it: **"L1 - Radar"**

## HOW TO USE LAYOUT 1

### MORNING SCAN (7:00 AM)

**Step 1: Check Market Indices (30 seconds)**
- Are SPY/QQQ green or red pre-market?
- What's VIX doing?
- This tells you the TONE for the day

**Step 2: Scan Sector Heatmap (90 seconds)**
- Cycle through your watchlists (use the dropdown to switch)
- Note which sectors are GREEN
- Note which specific tickers are BIGGEST green boxes
- Write down 3-5 names that stand out

**Step 3: Check News (60 seconds)**
- Any overnight catalysts on your tickers?
- Any sector-wide news?
- News explains WHY something is moving

### QUESTIONS L1 SHOULD ANSWER:

After 2-3 minutes in L1, you should know:

1. **Market Mode:**
   - [ ] Aggressive (indices green, VIX low)
   - [ ] Normal (mixed signals)
   - [ ] Defensive (indices red, VIX high)

2. **Hot Sectors Today:**
   - Which 1-2 of your watchlists are mostly green?

3. **Potential Candidates:**
   - Which 3-5 specific tickers are showing strength + volume?

4. **Catalyst Check:**
   - Do the moving tickers have news explaining the move?

---

## WHAT YOU DO NEXT

**If you found hot sectors and candidates:**
→ Move to Layout 2 (Filter) to validate them

**If nothing is moving or everything is red:**
→ Stay in L1 and monitor
→ Check back every 30 minutes
→ Don't force trades on slow days

**If VIX is spiking and indices are crashing:**
→ Stay in L1
→ Do NOT trade
→ Wait for stabilization

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### MISTAKE 1: Spending Too Long in L1
- L1 is for SCANNING, not analyzing
- If you're here more than 5 minutes, you're overthinking
- Get the quick read and move on

### MISTAKE 2: Trading Directly from L1
- You see a green ticker and immediately want to buy
- DON'T. You haven't validated the setup yet.
- Move to L2 first.

### MISTAKE 3: Ignoring Market Indices
- Your stocks don't exist in a vacuum
- If SPY is crashing, even good setups will fail
- ALWAYS check market first

### MISTAKE 4: Chasing the Biggest Mover
- Ticker up 20% might be DONE moving
- You want stocks STARTING to move, not finishing
- Look for 3-8% moves with high volume, not 20%+ moves

---

## PRO TIP: SECTOR ROTATION DETECTION

**This is how you find pops BEFORE they pop:**

1. Yesterday, Defense sector was flat/red
2. Today, Defense sector is green on the heatmap
3. But the moves are only 2-3% so far
4. Volume is 150%+ of average

**This is ROTATION.** Money is moving INTO this sector.

The stocks that haven't moved yet but are in this sector = YOUR OPPORTUNITIES.

**Example:**
- RCAT up 5%, KTOS up 3%, AVAV up 2%
- But ONDS only up 0.5% on light volume
- If the sector continues, ONDS might catch up
- Put ONDS on your L2 watchlist and monitor

---

## CHECKLIST BEFORE LEAVING L1

Before moving to L2, confirm:

- [ ] I know if today is Aggressive, Normal, or Defensive
- [ ] I identified which sector(s) are hot
- [ ] I have 3-5 specific tickers to investigate
- [ ] I checked news for catalysts
- [ ] I'm not forcing a trade on a dead day

---

## SCREENSHOT REFERENCE

Your L1 should look something like this:

```
