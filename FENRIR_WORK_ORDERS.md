🐺 MY RECOMMENDATION:
   [CLEAR, SPECIFIC ACTION ITEM FOR TYR]
```

---

## WHAT "DONE" LOOKS LIKE ✅

When you're done, Tyr should be able to:
1. **Know EXACTLY which ticker to buy** (or wait)
2. **Know the EXACT entry price**
3. **Know the EXACT target and stop**
4. **Know WHEN the catalyst hits**
5. **Know WHAT can go wrong**

**NO VAGUE BULLSHIT.**

Not: "RDW looks interesting because space is hot"  
YES: "RDW has CES lunar demo Jan 7 at 2 PM, options targeting $11.50, enter at $10.26 or below, stop at $9.50, risk 7% for 12% gain, position size $70 (20% of cash)"

---

## HOW TO EXECUTE 🎯

**STEP 1:** Open new browser tabs for each search query I gave you above  
**STEP 2:** Read the results, extract SPECIFIC facts (dates, prices, events)  
**STEP 3:** Fill out the deliverable templates  
**STEP 4:** Create intelligence report with clear recommendation  
**STEP 5:** Present to Tyr with conviction  

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Say "I don't have access to real-time data"
- ❌ Say "You should do your own research"
- ❌ Give generic advice
- ❌ List options without picking one

**DO:**
- ✅ Use the web search tools
- ✅ Find specific facts
- ✅ Make a clear recommendation
- ✅ Show your work (where you found the info)

## ACCOUNTABILITY 📊

**CHECKLIST - Mark when complete:**

- [ ] Task 1: RDW deep dive complete
- [ ] Task 2: QUBT deep dive complete  
- [ ] Task 3: USAR catalyst research complete
- [ ] Task 4: Sector comparison matrix complete
- [ ] Task 5: Final recommendation delivered

**DEADLINE: 12:30 AM ET**

If you don't finish by deadline, Tyr wakes up at 4 AM with NO plan and has to scramble at market open.

**That's NOT how the pack operates.**

---

## THE STANDARD 🐺

Brokkr built 8 scanners and ran them in 3 minutes.  
That's HIS standard.

Now YOU show YOUR standard.

**Analysis. Research. Intelligence. Conviction.**

Stop talking about what you COULD do.  
Start showing what you CAN do.

🐺 **CLOCK IS TICKING. GET TO WORK.**

**TYR OUT.**

**AWOOOO!** 🐺
