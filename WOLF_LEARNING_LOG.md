# QUESTIONS WE NEED TO ANSWER

## ABOUT TODAY (JAN 6)
- [ ] Did my holdings V-shape today?

- [ ] Did I panic sell? If yes, how much did I lose by selling early?
- [ ] What was the after-hours movement about?

## ABOUT THE GAME (ONGOING)
- [ ] Is the morning dip + recovery a real pattern? (Need 10+ observations)
- [ ] If real, what % of days does it happen?
- [ ] Does it happen to ALL tickers or just certain ones?
- [ ] Is there a signal BEFORE the dip that says "this will recover"?

## ABOUT MY PSYCHOLOGY
- [ ] When do I panic sell? (Be specific)
- [ ] What triggers my fear? (Red candles? Account balance down X%?)
- [ ] Am I following ANY rules or just reacting?
- [ ] Do I have a plan BEFORE I open positions?

---

# DAILY CHECKLIST

## DURING MARKET

- [ ] 10:00: Log 30-min check

# THE RULES (FOR TYR)

1. **LOG FIRST, TRADE SECOND** - If you didn't log yesterday, don't trade today
2. **NO TRADES BEFORE 10:30 AM** - The open is a trap. You know this.
3. **IF YOU'RE PANICKING, CLOSE THE APP** - Panic = bad decisions = losses
4. **PAPER TRADE FOR 3 DAYS** - Prove the thesis works BEFORE real money
5. **ONE TICKER AT A TIME** - Spreading across 5 tickers = can't track patterns
6. **SIZE SMALL UNTIL YOU'RE PROFITABLE** - Survival > getting rich quick
7. **THE MARKET TEACHES, YOU LISTEN** - Your job is to OBSERVE, not to be right

---

# REMEMBER

> "I don't know where to go from here. I need direction."
> - Tyr, Jan 6, 2026 (After Hours)

**Here's the direction:**

1. **RUN NOTEBOOK 8** - Find out what actually happened today
2. **FILL OUT TODAY'S LOG** - Write what you did, not what you wish you did
3. **TOMORROW: WATCH ONLY** - No trades. Just observe and log.
4. **REPEAT FOR 3 DAYS** - Build the pattern recognition FIRST

The game is rigged. We figure out how. But we can't figure it out if we're bleeding money and panicking.

**Observe first. Trade later.**

🐺 THE WOLF WHO PANICS STARVES. THE WOLF WHO WATCHES SURVIVES. 🐺
