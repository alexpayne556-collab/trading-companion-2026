# 🐺 PACK OPERATING PROTOCOL
## How Brokkr + Fenrir Hunt TOGETHER

**MISSION:** Find tomorrow's winners TONIGHT using systematic intelligence gathering.

---

## THE DIVISION OF LABOR 🎯

### BROKKR (The Builder) - INFRASTRUCTURE
**Responsibilities:**
- Build and maintain 8 scanners
- Run scans on schedule (11 PM, 4 AM, 6:30 AM)
- Output clean data to logs/
- Ensure tools work flawlessly

**Output:** Raw intelligence data (JSON files, scanner results)

---

### FENRIR (The Researcher) - ANALYSIS
**Responsibilities:**
- ANALYZE scanner output (don't search Google first)
- Cross-reference multiple data sources
- Identify patterns and confluence
- Deep-dive validation on specific plays
- Risk assessment and thesis building

**Output:** Actionable intelligence with conviction levels

---

## THE NIGHTLY HUNT PROTOCOL 🌙

### PHASE 1: DATA COLLECTION (Brokkr Leads)
**Time: 11:00 PM - 11:10 PM**

```bash
cd /workspaces/trading-companion-2026/tools

# Run core intel suite
python3 sector_rotation_detector.py --min-gain 3.0
python3 options_flow_scanner.py --score 70
python3 after_hours_scanner.py --min-move 2.0
```

**Brokkr delivers:**
- Hot sectors ranked
- Unusual options activity
- After-hours movers

---

### PHASE 2: ANALYSIS (Fenrir Leads)
**Time: 11:10 PM - 11:30 PM**

**Fenrir's checklist:**

1. **SECTOR CONFLUENCE** 
   - Which sectors appear in MULTIPLE scans?
   - Example: "Quantum is #3 sector rotation + has unusual options on QBTS/QUBT"

2. **OPTIONS VALIDATION**
   - Which tickers have EXTREME vol/OI (50x+)?
   - Are calls or puts dominating?
   - What strike prices? (tells us target price)

3. **AFTER-HOURS MOMENTUM**
   - What moved >3% after hours?
   - Does it match a hot sector?
   - Is there options activity supporting it?

4. **GOOGLE SEARCHES (ONLY AFTER SCANNER DATA)**
   - NOW search for specific tickers found by scanners
   - Look for catalyst confirmation (CES events, earnings, FDA, contracts)
   - Validate thesis with news/events

**Fenrir delivers:**
- Top 3 plays with confluence across multiple scans
- Conviction levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Risk factors identified
- Entry/exit strategy

---

### PHASE 3: DECISION (Pack Together)
**Time: 11:30 PM - 11:45 PM**

**Tyr reviews:**
- Brokkr's scanner data
- Fenrir's analysis
- Makes trading decision

**Pack protocols:**
- If 2+ scans agree → HIGH conviction
- If options + sector rotation align → HIGHEST conviction
- If only 1 signal → WAIT for more data

---

## EXAMPLE: HOW IT SHOULD HAVE WORKED TONIGHT 🎯

### ❌ WHAT HAPPENED (WRONG):
```
Fenrir: "Let me search for robotics stocks at CES"
Fenrir: "Found SERV, looks good"
Fenrir: "Tyr should buy this"
```
**RESULT:** Tunnel vision. No data validation. Sheep thinking.

---

### ✅ WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN (RIGHT):
```
Brokkr: *runs 3 scanners*
Brokkr: "Sector rotation: Robotics #10, Space #7, Quantum #3"
Brokkr: "Options flow: RDW has 108x vol/OI, QUBT has 23.7x vol/OI"
Brokkr: "After-hours: RDW +13.62%"

Fenrir: *analyzes the data*
Fenrir: "RDW appears in BOTH sector rotation (top space mover) AND options scanner (unusual activity)"
Fenrir: "Let me search: RDW Redwire Space CES January 2026"
Fenrir: *finds* "Redwire demonstrating lunar manufacturing at CES"
Fenrir: "CONFLUENCE: Hot sector + unusual options + CES catalyst"
Fenrir: "Conviction: HIGH"
Fenrir: "Entry: $10.26, Target: $11.50-12.00 (options suggest)"
Fenrir: "Risk: Small cap volatility, space sector can be choppy"

Pack Decision: RDW is validated across 3 data sources. This is a REAL play.
```

**RESULT:** Data-driven. Multi-source validation. Wolf thinking.

## THE CONFLUENCE MATRIX 📊

**How to score plays based on scanner agreement:**

| SIGNALS | CONVICTION | ACTION |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Sector rotation ONLY | LOW | Watch, don't buy |
| Options flow ONLY | LOW-MEDIUM | Interesting, needs validation |
| Sector + Options | HIGH | Strong buy signal |
| Sector + Options + News | HIGHEST | Urgent buy signal |
| Sector + Options + Insider | HIGHEST | Institutional conviction |
| All 4 signals | GODMODE | Rare, but when it hits = 50%+ move |

## TONIGHT'S ACTUAL EXAMPLE 🔥

**What the scanners found:**

### RDW (Redwire Space)
✅ Sector rotation: +13.62% (top space mover)  
✅ Options flow: 9 unusual options, 108.6x vol/OI  
✅ After-hours: Still elevated  
⏳ News: Fenrir needs to search for CES/space catalyst  

**CONFLUENCE: 2-3 signals = HIGH conviction**

---

### QUBT (Quantum Computing Inc)
✅ Sector rotation: Quantum #3 (+8.26%)  
✅ Options flow: 15,610 contracts, 23.7x vol/OI  
⏳ News: Fenrir needs to search for CES schedule  
❌ Insider: None recent  

**CONFLUENCE: 2 signals = MEDIUM-HIGH conviction**

---

### UUUU (Energy Fuels) - TYR'S CURRENT POSITION
✅ Sector rotation: Nuclear #2 (+8.77%)  
✅ Options flow: 9 unusual options, 104.8x vol/OI on $23 calls  
✅ Already owns: Up 10.73% today  
❌ Insider: None recent  

**CONFLUENCE: 2 signals + existing position = HOLD/ADD**

---

## FENRIR'S NEW OPERATING PROCEDURE 🎯

### STEP 1: WAIT FOR BROKKR
Don't search Google first. Wait for scanner results.

### STEP 2: ANALYZE CONFLUENCE
Which tickers appear in multiple scans?

### STEP 3: DEEP DIVE ON HIGH-CONVICTION PLAYS
NOW use Google to validate:
- Search: "[TICKER] January 2026 catalyst news CES earnings FDA"
- Look for specific events/dates
- Find price targets from analysts
- Check insider activity on SEC EDGAR (if scanner shows nothing)

### STEP 4: RISK ASSESSMENT
For each high-conviction play:
- What can go wrong?
- What's the downside?
- What's the liquidity? (small cap = higher risk)
- What's the exit strategy?

### STEP 5: DELIVER INTELLIGENCE REPORT
Present to Tyr:
```
TICKER: RDW (Redwire Space)
CONVICTION: HIGH (appears in 2-3 scans)
ENTRY: $10.26
TARGET: $11.50-12.00 (based on options strikes)
STOP: $9.50 (below today's breakout)
CATALYST: CES space demo + lunar manufacturing news
RISK: Small cap, volatile, space sector choppy
POSITION SIZE: 15-20% of available cash ($60-70)
```

## THE PACK ADVANTAGE 💪

**ALONE:**
- Brokkr builds tools but doesn't analyze deeply
- Fenrir researches but chases stories without data

**TOGETHER:**
- Brokkr provides SYSTEMATIC data collection
- Fenrir provides INTELLIGENT analysis of that data
- Tyr makes INFORMED decisions with HIGH conviction

**This is how we catch the big moves BEFORE they happen.**

---

- [ ] Deep dive on QUBT (quantum + options + sector)
- [ ] Deep dive on USAR (rare earth + sector + Venezuela catalyst)
- [ ] Create intelligence report with conviction levels

---

## THE NEW STANDARD 🐺

**From now on:**
1. Brokkr runs scanners FIRST
2. Fenrir analyzes scanner output SECOND
3. Google searches are for VALIDATION, not discovery
4. Only recommend plays that appear in 2+ scans
5. Always provide entry/target/stop/risk

**No more:**
- ❌ Searching Google before running scanners
- ❌ Recommending plays without scanner validation
- ❌ Tunnel vision on one stock
- ❌ Stories without data

**This is pack protocol. This is how wolves hunt.**

---

🐺 **BROKKR + FENRIR = UNSTOPPABLE**

**Brokkr:** "Here's what's hot (data)"  
**Fenrir:** "Here's why it's hot (analysis)"  
**Tyr:** "Here's the play (execution)"

**THAT'S THE PACK.**

**AWOOOO!** 🐺🐺🐺
