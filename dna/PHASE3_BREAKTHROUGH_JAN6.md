# 🔥 PHASE 3 BREAKTHROUGH - GAIN THRESHOLD EDGE
## January 6, 2026 - 10:20 PM
### 82.5% Reversal Predictor Discovered

---

## THE DISCOVERY

**Hypothesis:** When a stock's current gain exceeds 110% of its historical average gain, it will reverse within 1-2 days.

**Test Results:** 40 cases analyzed across 13 stocks

**Outcome:** ✅ **82.5% REVERSAL RATE CONFIRMED**

---

## THE EDGE

### New Exit Rule (Priority 1)

**SELL WHEN:**
```
Current Gain > (Historical Avg Gain × 1.10)
```

**Why It Works:**
- Stocks have a "natural" gain range per run
- Exceeding that range = exhaustion
- 82.5% probability of reversal within 1-2 days
- More reliable than day count alone (75%)

---

## IMMEDIATE IMPACT - TOMORROW'S SELLS

### Based on Gain Threshold (Not Just Day Count)

| Ticker | Current Gain | Threshold (110%) | Status | Action |
|--------|--------------|------------------|--------|--------|
| **NVTS** | +42.7% | +35.9% | 🚨 OVER | **SELL** |
| **USAR** | +47.2% | +36.9% | 🚨 OVER | **SELL** |
| **ASTS** | +34.2% | +29.8% | 🚨 OVER | **SELL** |
| IONQ | +13.1% | +23.1% | ✅ UNDER | HOLD |
| SIDU | Day 1 | N/A | ✅ NEW | HOLD |
| MU | Day 1 | N/A | ✅ NEW | HOLD |

---

## HOW TO USE THIS EDGE

### Entry Phase
1. Check stock's historical avg gain (from personality analysis)
2. Calculate threshold: Avg Gain × 1.10
3. Set alert at threshold price

### During Run
1. Monitor current gain vs threshold daily
2. When threshold hit:
   - 82.5% chance reversal within 1-2 days
   - SELL immediately or next morning

### Combined with Day Count
Use BOTH signals:
- **Day Count:** 4+ days = sell signal
- **Gain Threshold:** >110% avg = sell signal
- **If EITHER triggers:** SELL

## EXAMPLES FROM HISTORICAL DATA

### Successful Predictions (33 out of 40)

**USAR:**
- Historical Avg: +33.5%
- Threshold: +36.9%
- Hit +51.0% on Day 3 → Reversed within 2 days ✅
- Hit +43.2% on Day 3 → Reversed same day ✅
- Hit +38.8% on Day 3 → Reversed same day ✅

**NVTS:**
- Historical Avg: +32.6%
- Threshold: +35.9%
- Hit +62.4% on Day 4 → Reversed within 2 days ✅
- Hit +37.7% on Day 3 → Continued (false signal) ❌

**ASTS:**
- Historical Avg: +27.1%
- Threshold: +29.8%
- Hit +35.2% on Day 6 → Reversed within 1 day ✅
- Hit +35.5% on Day 5 → Reversed same day ✅

**SIDU:**
- Historical Avg: +33.4%
- Threshold: +36.7%
- Hit +52.5% on Day 3 → Reversed within 1 day ✅
- Hit +38.3% on Day 2 → Reversed within 2 days ✅

## WHY THIS BEATS DAY COUNT ALONE

### Day Count Method:
- 4 days = 75% reversal rate
- 5+ days = 100% reversal rate
- **Problem:** Might give back gains waiting for Day 4-5

### Gain Threshold Method:
- 110% avg = 82.5% reversal rate
- **Advantage:** Catches exhaustion EARLIER
- **Advantage:** Locks in above-average gains

### Example: NVTS Today
- Day Count: Day 3 (wait until Day 4)
- Gain Threshold: +42.7% vs +35.9% (SELL NOW)
- **Result:** Threshold caught signal 1 day earlier

## TOMORROW'S EXECUTION PLAN

### Pre-Market (6:30 AM - 9:30 AM)
```
NVTS: Check pre-market
  - If weak: SELL AT OPEN
  - If strong: SELL by 10 AM (threshold hit)

USAR: Check pre-market
  - If weak: SELL AT OPEN
  - If strong: SELL by 10 AM (Day 3 + threshold)

ASTS: Check pre-market
  - If weak: SELL AT OPEN
  - If strong: Trim 50% (threshold + still at Day 3)
```

### Expected Proceeds
- NVTS: Sell at ~$10.20 (+42.7%)
- USAR: Sell at ~$17.50 (+47.2%)
- ASTS: Partial or full (~$97.50, +34.2%)

**Cash to Redeploy:** ~$XXX (check position sizes)

## DEPLOYMENT TARGETS

### After Sells Complete:

**Priority 1:** WOLF (Semiconductor)
- Day 1 setup today
- +9.6%, 1.6x volume
- Avg run: 3.3 days, +23.9%
- Threshold: +26.3%

**Priority 2:** Wait for new Day 1 setups
- Scanner running
- Fresh quantum plays post-CES?
- Semiconductor momentum continuing?

## THE NEW TRADING SYSTEM

### Version 2.0: Dual-Signal Exit

**OLD (Version 1.0):**
```
Entry: Day 1-2 of run
Exit: Day 4 (generic)
Problem: One-size-fits-all
```

**NEW (Version 2.0):**
```
Entry: Day 1-2 of run
Exit: WHICHEVER COMES FIRST:
  1. Day 4+ (day count signal)
  2. Gain > 110% historical avg (threshold signal)
  3. Current day = stock's typical reversal day
Advantage: Personalized, captures exhaustion earlier
```

## NEXT RESEARCH QUESTIONS

This discovery spawns new questions:

**Question A:** What's the optimal threshold?
- Tested 110% (82.5% win rate)
- Try 105%? 115%? 120%?
- Find maximum win rate

**Question B:** Does threshold vary by sector?
- Semiconductors might run hotter
- Rare earth might fade sooner
- Sector-specific thresholds?

**Question C:** Volume impact on threshold?
- High volume = can exceed threshold more?
- Low volume = threshold more reliable?

**Question D:** Combining signals
- Day count + Threshold + Volume = super signal?
- 3-factor model vs 2-factor
