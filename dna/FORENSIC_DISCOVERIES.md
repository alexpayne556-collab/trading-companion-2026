# 🐺 FORENSIC DISCOVERIES - What Actually Works

## Date: Jan 13, 2026

**THE SHIFT:** Stop fitting patterns to data. Work BACKWARDS from moves to find signals.

## MONDAY JAN 12 MOVERS - ANALYZED

### VOLUME SIGNALS (Most Common)

**ALMS +7.9%:**
- D-3: Volume +61% vs 20d avg
- D-2: Volume +70% vs 20d avg
- Pattern: **Accumulation 2-3 days before breakout**
- Also showed: Higher lows (accumulation pattern)

**WDC +9.6%:**
- D-3: Volume +55% vs 20d avg
- D-2: Volume +29% vs 20d avg
- Pattern: **Volume spike 2-3 days before move**

**OCGN +14.8%:**
- D-5: Volume +20% vs avg
- Pattern: Earlier signal, moved on JPM catalyst

### SECTOR CORRELATION (Strong Signal)

**Crypto Miners - Moved Together:**
- RIOT +7.5%
- WULF +7.0%
- Pattern: **When sector leader moves, others follow**

**Storage - Moved Together:**
- WDC +9.6%
- STX +7.4%
- Pattern: **Sector rotation, catch first mover then enter peers**

### ACCUMULATION PATTERNS

**ALMS, RIOT:**
- Both showed "higher lows" pattern
- Pattern: **Price not falling, volume building, then breakout**

---

## SIGNALS THAT APPEAR MOST:

1. **VOLUME_SPIKE (37 occurrences)** → Avg peak +9.5%
   - Look for +20-50% volume spikes 2-3 days BEFORE move
   - Most reliable early signal

2. **HIGHER_LOWS (2 occurrences)** → Avg peak +7.7%
   - Accumulation pattern, smart money building position

3. **GAP (1 occurrence)** → Avg peak +14.2%
   - Morning gap = catalyst already happened, catch or miss

---

## THE SYSTEM NEEDS:

### 1. **Volume Spike Alerts**
When ANY ticker shows +30% volume vs 20d avg → Flag it
Don't wait for price move → Volume tells you BEFORE

### 2. **Sector Correlation Tracker**
When WDC moves +5% → Auto-check STX, MU, MRVL
When RIOT moves → Auto-check WULF, CLSK, MARA
**Catch sector rotation in real-time**

### 3. **Accumulation Detector**
Track tickers showing:
- Higher lows over 3-5 days
- Volume increasing
- Low volatility (base building)
**These are setups BEFORE the move**

### 4. **News Catalyst Window**
Check news 1-7 days BEFORE move
OCGN had JPM presentation Thursday → Moved Monday
**News precedes move by days, not hours**

---

## WHAT THIS MEANS:

**OLD WAY:**
- Wait for +20% move → Too late
- Look for specific patterns (GPU whale) → Too narrow

**NEW WAY:**
- Volume +30% on D-2 → **FLAG IT**
- RIOT +5% → **CHECK WULF/CLSK/MARA NOW**
- ALMS building base + volume → **WATCH FOR BREAKOUT**
- News catalyst 3-5 days before event → **POSITION NOW**

---

## ACTION ITEMS:

1. ✅ **Forensic analyzer working** - can analyze any mover
2. ⚠️ **Need:** Volume spike scanner (flag +30% vol before price moves)
3. ⚠️ **Need:** Sector correlation mapper (when X moves, check Y/Z)
4. ⚠️ **Need:** Accumulation detector (higher lows + vol buildup)
5. ⚠️ **Need:** Catalyst calendar integrated (JPM, PDUFA, earnings)

---

## THE TRUTH:

**We can't predict what will move.**
**But we CAN see accumulation 2-3 days before it breaks out.**
**And we CAN catch sector rotation when first ticker moves +5%.**

That's the edge. Not prediction. **Detection.**

🐺 AWOOOO
