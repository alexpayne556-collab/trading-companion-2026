# 🏹 THE ROBIN HOOD PLAYBOOK
## How to Join the Song (Not Beat the Orchestra)

*Updated: Jan 7, 2026 - The Wolf Pack's Operational Manual*

---

## THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

> **"We don't predict where they're going. We SEE where they ARE and get there EARLY."**

**We can't beat them at:**
- Speed (they have direct market access)
- Information (Bloomberg terminals, private calls)
- Capital (billions vs our hundreds)
- Prediction (better models, more data)

**We CAN beat them at:**
- **PATIENCE** - They MUST deploy capital. We don't.
- **FLEXIBILITY** - They have mandates. We don't.
- **INVISIBILITY** - They file 13Fs. We don't leave traces.
- **SPEED OF DECISION** - No committees. Just you.
- **SIZE ADVANTAGE** - We don't move prices. They do.

## THE INFORMATION FLOW (Where We Fit In)

```
1. EVENT HAPPENS (insider knowledge)
   │
2. INSTITUTIONS POSITION (dark pools, options - we can't see clearly)
   │
3. SIGNALS APPEAR ← 🏹 THIS IS WHERE WE ENTER
   │  - Form 4 filings
   │  - 8-K material events  
   │  - Options unusual activity
   │  - Premarket gaps
   │  - Dark pool prints
   │
4. NEWS HITS (catalysts go public)
   │
5. ALGOS REACT (keyword scanning, momentum)
   │
6. SMART RETAIL SEES IT ← 🐺 WE'RE ALREADY IN
   │
7. MEDIA AMPLIFIES (CNBC, Twitter, Reddit)
   │
8. DUMB RETAIL FOMO ← 💰 WE'RE TRIMMING/EXITING
   │
9. DISTRIBUTION/TOP ← 🏃 WE'RE OUT
```

**Our edge: Enter at Step 3, Exit at Step 8.**

LOW CONVICTION (IGNORE):
✗ Director buys $10K (token amount)
✗ Scheduled insider buys (10b5-1 plans)

```

### LAYER 2: SECTOR FLOW TRACKER 🌊
**Where's the money flowing TODAY?**

#### What to Track:
```
SECTOR HEAT MAP (Daily):
- Which sector is leading today?
- Which sector led yesterday but fading today?
- Is money ROTATING from A → B?
- Where is VOLUME concentrating?

THEME IDENTIFICATION:
Current Hot Themes (as of Jan 7):
1. AI Fuel Chain
   - Nuclear power (AI needs electricity)
   - Space infrastructure (AI needs data)
   - Compute hardware (AI needs chips)

2. Defense/Space
   - Government contracts
   - Satellite networks

3. Quantum Computing
   - Still speculative but moving
```

#### How to Use It:
1. **Sector Rotation Scanner** (we'll build this)
   - Show daily % change by sector
   - Identify: "Quantum peaked, Nuclear starting"
   
2. **Follow the Flow**
   - When Quantum goes cold (RSI >75, volume fading)
   - Look for Nuclear heating up (RSI <50, volume rising)
   - Enter the NEXT hot sector, not the LAST one

### LAYER 3: QUALITY FILTER 🔍
**Right ticker or bleeder?**

### LAYER 4: TIMING ENGINE ⏰
**When to enter, when to add, when to exit?**

#### Entry Signals (When to BUY):

**BEST ENTRY (Robin Hood Sweet Spot):**
```
✓ Quality ticker (passes scorecard)
✓ Hot sector (money flowing IN)
✓ Early in move (Day 0-1, not Day 5)
✓ Conviction signal (Form 4 buy OR options sweep OR 8-K)
✓ RSI < 50 (not extended)
✓ Volume rising (accumulation)

EXAMPLE:
- Jan 3: CEO of UUUU buys $500K (Form 4 filed Jan 5)
- Jan 4-5: Stock consolidating, RSI 45
- Jan 6: Premarket gap on energy news
- ← ENTER HERE (9:30am or premarket if possible)
```

**GOOD ENTRY (Dip in Hot Ticker):**
```
✓ Quality ticker (passes scorecard)
✓ Sector still hot (hasn't rotated away)
✓ Pullback to support (RSI 30-40)
✓ Insider still buying or holding
✓ No thesis break (no dilution news, no insider dump)

EXAMPLE:
- NVTS runs from $8 → $12
- Pulls back to $10 (20% dip)
- Sector still hot, no bad news
- ← ADD HERE (average down if quality)
```

**BAD ENTRY (Don't Do This):**
```
✗ Already up 50%+ in a week (RSI >75)
✗ No conviction signal (just momentum)
✗ Bleeder (fails quality scorecard)
✗ Sector rotating away (money leaving)
✗ Chasing headlines (news already priced in)

EXAMPLE:
- SIDU gaps to $20 on no news
- You FOMO in at $22
- It crashes to $10 next day
- ← THIS IS BEING EXIT LIQUIDITY
```

#### Exit Signals (When to SELL):

**TRIM PROFITS (Scale Out):**
```
When ticker hits:
- RSI >75 (overbought)
- Up 30%+ from entry
- Volume declining (distribution)
- Reddit/Twitter going crazy (retail FOMO peak)

ACTION: Sell 25-50% to take profit
KEEP: Remaining position rides
```

**FULL EXIT (Get Out):**
```
When thesis breaks:
- Insiders dumping (multiple Form 4 sells)
- Dilution announced (secondary offering)
- Sector goes cold (rotation away)
- Technical break (loses key support)
- Down 20% from entry (stop loss hit)

ACTION: Sell 100%, move on
```

**HOLD FOREVER (Quality Compounder):**
```
When ticker is:
- Blue chip quality (MU, NVDA level)
- Growing revenue >20%/year
- Insiders buying
- Thesis still intact
- You have conviction

ACTION: Hold, add on major dips
```

---

### LAYER 5: BLEEDER DETECTION 🚨
**When to run, not walk.**

#### Red Flags (Exit Immediately):

| Warning Sign | What It Means | Action |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| CEO sells >25% holdings | No confidence | SELL |
| Secondary offering announced | Dilution coming | SELL |
| Revenue guidance cut | Business struggling | SELL |
| CFO resigns | Something's wrong | SELL |
| Sector goes cold | Money rotating away | TRIM |
| Stock breaks 200-day MA | Technical break | STOP LOSS |
| High short interest + bad news | Death spiral risk | SELL |

#### Early Warning Signs (Watch Closely):

| Warning Sign | What to Do |
|--------------|-----------|
| Insider selling (not dumping) | Reduce position size |
| RSI <30 for 2+ weeks | Either dead or bottoming - wait |
| Volume drying up | Interest fading - monitor |
| Options put/call ratio >2 | Bearish positioning - careful |

## THE ACTUAL WORKFLOW (How to Use This Daily)

### 🌅 PREMARKET (7:00am - 9:30am)

**CHECK:**
1. **Finviz Premarket** - What's gapping? Why?
2. **Your Holdings** - Any news overnight?
3. **SEC EDGAR** - Any Form 4 or 8-K filed yesterday evening?
4. **Twitter/News** - Any sector catalysts?

**DECISION TREE:**
```
IF quality ticker gapping on real news:
   → Consider buying at open (or premarket if RH Gold)

IF your holding gapping DOWN on bad news:
   → Check if thesis broken → EXIT

IF sector rotation detected:
   → Rotate capital to hot sector
```

### 📊 MARKET OPEN (9:30am - 10:30am)

**THE V-PATTERN WINDOW:**
- First 30 min often dip (stop losses, profit taking)
- 10:00-10:30 often recovery
- **STRATEGY:** Buy the dip if quality ticker

**EXECUTION:**
```
IF on watchlist + passes quality + dips 5-10%:
   → BUY in the 10-10:30 window
   
IF holding + gaps up big:
   → TRIM 25-50% into strength
```

### 📈 MIDDAY (10:30am - 3:00pm)

**MONITOR:**
- Is your thesis still intact?
- Any new Form 4s or 8-Ks?
- Sector still hot?

**MOSTLY:** Do nothing. Let it ride.

### 🔔 CLOSE (3:00pm - 4:00pm)

**REVIEW:**
- What worked today? Why?
- What failed? Why?
- Any overnight risk? (earnings, news)
- Update watchlist

### 🌙 AFTERHOURS (4:00pm - 8:00pm)

**CHECK SEC EDGAR:**
- Form 4s filed after close
- 8-Ks dropped
- Add to tomorrow's watchlist

**PREPARE:**
- Alerts set for premarket gaps
- Orders ready if needed

## POSITION SIZING & RISK MANAGEMENT

### With ~$1,350 Total Capital:

**ALLOCATION:**
```
CORE POSITIONS (60% = ~$810):
- 2-3 quality tickers you believe in
- MU, IONQ, UUUU type (real business)
- Hold through noise, add on big dips

SWING POSITIONS (30% = ~$405):
- 2-3 momentum plays
- NVTS, USAR type (hot sector)
- Scale in/out, take profits

SPECULATION (10% = ~$135):
- 1-2 high risk/reward
- ASTS, SIDU type (could 10x or zero)
- Small size, let it ride or die
```

**PER TRADE RISK:**
```
MAX RISK: 5% of account per trade
With $1,350 → $67 max risk

IF entry at $10 with stop at $8:
- Risk per share = $2
- Max shares = $67 / $2 = 33 shares
- Position size = $330

This way, even if stopped out, you only lose $67 (5%)
```

**STOP LOSS RULES:**
```
QUALITY TICKERS: -20% stop (give them room)
SWING TRADES: -15% stop (less conviction)
SPECULATION: -30% stop OR thesis break
```
