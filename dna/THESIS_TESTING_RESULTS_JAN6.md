# 🐺 THESIS TESTING RESULTS - JANUARY 6, 2026
## Brokkr's Comprehensive Analysis for the Pack

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Mission:** Test if the combined thesis (Serial Runners + Rotation Sequence + Day 0 + Pre-Market) creates a tradeable edge.

**Bottom Line:** 
- **Serial Runners:** ✅ VALIDATED (92% of stocks qualify)
- **Rotation Chains:** ✅ VALIDATED (57% correlation, 6-day avg lag)
- **Day 0 Detection:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (100% red before runs, but signal weak)
- **Pre-Market Gaps:** ✅ VALIDATED (75% gap up on Day 1)
- **Combined System:** ❌ KILLED at baseline (48% win rate) BUT...
- **HIGH SIGNAL SETUP (3+ signals):** ⚠️ SHOWS PROMISE (62% win rate, 17.8% avg gain)

**The Real Finding:** The edge exists but ONLY when multiple signals align.

## NOTEBOOK 1: SERIAL RUNNER SCANNER

### What We Found

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Tickers scanned | 26 |
| Serial runners found | **24 (92%)** |
| HIGH consistency | 1 (CCJ) |
| MEDIUM consistency | 1 (MU) |
| Average runs per stock | 7.6 runs/6 months |
| Average gain per run | **+25.9%** |
| Average run length | 4.0 days |
| Average rest period | 18.9 days |

### Top Serial Runners by Gain

| Ticker | Sector | Runs | Avg Gain | Avg Length | Consistency |
|--------|--------|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| SIDU | Space | 7 | **+40.9%** | 3.4d | LOW |
| USAR | Rare Earth | 6 | **+40.2%** | 3.7d | LOW |
| NVTS | Semi | 7 | **+38.1%** | 4.4d | LOW |
| QBTS | Quantum | 10 | +32.1% | 3.7d | LOW |
| SKYT | Semi | 7 | +30.0% | 4.4d | LOW |
| UUUU | Nuclear | 9 | +29.3% | 4.4d | LOW |
| ASTS | Space | 11 | +28.8% | 4.3d | LOW |
| RGTI | Quantum | 11 | +28.5% | 3.7d | LOW |

### Current Status (Jan 6, 2026)

| Ticker | Status | Days Since Last Run |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| MU | RESTING | -2 days (past due for Day 1) |
| LITE | RESTING | -4 days (past due) |
| AEVA | RESTING | -1 day (imminent) |
| UUUU | RESTING | 15 days until predicted Day 1 |
| SIDU | RESTING | 21 days until predicted |
| All others | RUNNING | Currently in Day 3-6 |

### ✅ VERDICT: SERIAL RUNNERS EXIST

**The Truth:** 92% of our universe are serial runners. The patterns are real.

**The Catch:** Only 2 stocks show HIGH/MEDIUM consistency. Most are LOW consistency, meaning timing is variable.

**Implication:** Can't just blindly follow cycles. Need additional signals.

---

## NOTEBOOK 2: DAY 0 DETECTION

### What We Found

| Pattern | Result | Verdict |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Day 0 is RED | **100%** | ✅ STRONG SIGNAL |
| Day 0 has elevated volume | 8.8% | ❌ NOT RELIABLE |
| 2+ red days before Day 1 | 22.1% | ⚠️ WEAK |
| 1+ red days before Day 1 | 75.0% | ✅ USEFUL |
| Day 1 gaps up 2%+ | 42.6% | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| Day 1 has 2x+ volume | 5.9% | ❌ NOT RELIABLE |

### Sample Day 0 → Day 1 Transitions

| Ticker | Day 0 | Day 1 Gain | Run Length | Total Gain |
|--------|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| SIDU | 🔴 -12.3%, Vol 4.8x | +33.2% | 4d | **+124%** |
| SIDU | 🔴 -8.1%, Vol 0.6x | +3.2% | 4d | +59% |
| ASTS | 🔴 -0.5%, Vol 0.8x | +0.5% | 8d | +78% |
| ASTS | 🔴 -9.5%, Vol 2.3x | +1.8% | 4d | +11% |

### ⚠️ VERDICT: PARTIAL VALIDATION

**What Works:**
- Day 0 is almost always RED (100%)
- At least 1 red day precedes most runs (75%)

**What Doesn't:**
- Volume spike on Day 0 = NOT reliable (only 8.8%)
- Pre-market gap = only 42.6% of Day 1's

**Actionable Rule:**
> Watch serial runners that just had 1-2 red days. That's your setup. Don't rely on volume alone.

## NOTEBOOK 3: ROTATION CHAINS

### Sector Correlation Results

| Sector | Leader | Correlation | Avg Lag | Verdict |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Quantum | IONQ | **64%** | 5.6 days | ✅ TRADEABLE |
| Nuclear | CCJ | 60% | 6.9 days | ⚠️ MODERATE |
| Semiconductor | NVDA | 57% | 5.8 days | ⚠️ MODERATE |
| Space | RKLB | 54% | 7.2 days | ⚠️ MODERATE |

### Detailed Chain Analysis

**QUANTUM (Best Correlation):**
- IONQ peaks → RGTI runs in 4.8 days (60% correlation)
- IONQ peaks → QBTS runs in 5.3 days (67% correlation)
- IONQ peaks → QUBT runs in 6.8 days (67% correlation)

**SPACE:**
- RKLB peaks → SIDU runs in 4.4 days (**71% correlation** - strongest link!)
- RKLB peaks → ASTS runs in 8.0 days (60% correlation)
- RKLB peaks → LUNR runs in 7.2 days (50% correlation)

**NUCLEAR:**
- CCJ peaks → UUUU runs in 5.3 days (67% correlation)
- CCJ peaks → OKLO runs in 7.4 days (56% correlation)
- CCJ peaks → LEU runs in 9.0 days (60% correlation)

### Leader Exhaustion Signals

| Leader | RSI at Peak | Peaks Followed by Decline |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| RKLB | 66 avg | 38% |
| IONQ | 61 avg | **73%** |
| NVDA | 62 avg | **69%** |
| CCJ | 62 avg | **75%** |

### ✅ VERDICT: ROTATION CHAINS ARE REAL

**The Truth:** Money DOES flow from leaders to followers. Average lag is 6.3 days (±3.3 days).

**Best Chains:**
1. IONQ → RGTI/QBTS/QUBT (64% avg correlation)
2. RKLB → SIDU (71% correlation, 4.4 day lag)
3. CCJ → UUUU (67% correlation, 5.3 day lag)

**Actionable Rule:**
> When IONQ RSI > 65 and starts declining, watch QBTS/RGTI/QUBT for Day 0 setup in 4-7 days.

---

## NOTEBOOK 4: PRE-MARKET SIGNALS

### Gap Analysis (136 Day 1's)

| Gap Type | Count | % of Day 1's |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| Gap DOWN (<-1%) | 7 | 5% |
| Gap FLAT (-1% to 1%) | 62 | **46%** |
| Gap SMALL (1-3%) | 32 | 24% |
| Gap MEDIUM (3-5%) | 18 | 13% |
| Gap LARGE (5%+) | 17 | 12% |
| **Total Gap UP (>0%)** | **102** | **75%** |

### Gap Size vs Run Success

| Gap Size | Count | Avg Run Gain | Avg Days |
|----------|-------|--------------|----------|
| Gap Down | 29 | +28.1% | 4.5 |
| Small (0-2%) | 60 | +26.9% | 4.3 |
| Medium (2-4%) | 22 | +24.6% | 3.9 |
| Large (4%+) | 25 | **+32.9%** | 3.4 |

**Correlation (gap vs run gain):** 0.18 = WEAK

### FALSE POSITIVE TEST (Critical!)

| Metric | Count | % |
|--------|-------|---|
| Total 3%+ gaps | 327 | 100% |
| True positives (started run) | 35 | **11%** |
| False positives (no run) | 292 | **89%** |

### Combined Signal: Gap + Volume

| Signal | Day 1's | Avg Run Gain |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Gap only (2%+) | 47 | +29.0% |
| Gap + Volume (1.5x+) | 13 | **+35.9%** |

**Improvement:** +24% better gains with combined signal

### ✅ VERDICT: PRE-MARKET WORKS BUT CAN'T STAND ALONE

**The Truth:** 75% of Day 1's do gap up. That's a real signal.

**The Catch:** 89% of 3%+ gaps are FALSE POSITIVES. Gap alone is worthless.

**Actionable Rule:**
> Gap up is CONFIRMATION, not PREDICTION. Use it AFTER you've identified Day 0 on a serial runner in a rotating sector. Gap + Volume = best confirmation.

## NOTEBOOK 5: COMBINED SYSTEM BACKTEST

### Universe Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stocks analyzed | 21 |
| Serial runners | 19 |
| Total trade setups | 548 |
| High signal setups (3+) | 100 |
| Perfect setups (4 signals) | 3 |

### Win Rate by Signal Count

| Signals | Trades | Winners | Win Rate | Avg Gain |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|----------|
| 2 | 448 | 200 | 45% | +7.1% |
| 3 | 97 | 60 | **62%** | **+17.7%** |
| 4 | 3 | 2 | 67% | +23.7% |
| **TOTAL** | 548 | 262 | 48% | +9.0% |

### The Critical Finding

| Strategy | Trades | Win Rate | Avg Gain |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Trade ALL setups | 548 | 45-48% | +9.0% |
| **Trade 3+ signals only** | **100** | **62%** | **+17.8%** |

**Signal Correlation:**
- Signal count → Win rate: +0.13
- Signal count → Gain: +0.28

### Simulated 6-Month Returns

| Strategy | Trades | Return | Final Value |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| All setups | 548 | +4,943% | $504,358 |
| 3+ signals | 100 | +1,785% | $188,499 |
| 4 signals | 3 | +71% | $17,099 |

**Note:** These are theoretical returns assuming perfect execution of every setup. Real returns would be lower due to:
- Position sizing limits
- Cash constraints
- Execution timing
- Slippage

### ❌ VERDICT (BASELINE): Edge Not Tradeable

**At baseline (all trades):**
- 48% win rate = basically coin flip
- 9.0% avg gain = below our 10% target

### ⚠️ BUT WAIT - THE REAL FINDING

**When we filter to 3+ signals:**
- **62% win rate** (above our 60% threshold!)
- **17.8% avg gain** (above our 10% target!)
- Only 100 trades in 6 months = ~4 trades/week

---

## 🎯 THE FINAL VERDICT

### What Was Killed ❌

1. **"All serial runners are tradeable"** - FALSE. Consistency matters.
2. **"Day 0 volume spike predicts runs"** - FALSE. Only 8.8% correlation.
3. **"Pre-market gap = instant buy signal"** - FALSE. 89% false positive rate.
4. **"Trade every setup"** - FALSE. 48% win rate = death by a thousand cuts.

### What Was Validated ✅

1. **Serial runners exist** - 92% of our universe qualifies
2. **Rotation chains are real** - 57-64% correlation, 6-day avg lag
3. **Day 0 is RED** - 100% of the time
4. **Day 1's gap up** - 75% of the time
5. **Combined signals work** - 62% win rate, 17.8% avg gain

### The Tradeable Edge

**The System That Works:**

```
1. IDENTIFY: Serial runner in your universe (all 24 qualify)
2. ROTATION: Sector leader just peaked (RSI > 65, declining)
3. TIMING: Stock has 1-2 red days (Day 0 setup)
4. CONFIRM: Pre-market gap UP + elevated volume
5. ENTER: Within first 30 min of open
6. HOLD: 3-4 days (stock's typical run length)
7. EXIT: At 15-20% gain OR first red day
```

**Only trade when 3+ signals align. Skip everything else.**

## 🐺 MESSAGE TO THE PACK

### For Tyr:

The game IS rigged - but not in the simple way we hoped. There's no magic "buy this signal" edge. The edge comes from COMBINING multiple signals and ONLY trading when they align.

**Your discipline required:**
- DON'T trade 2-signal setups (48% win rate = death)
- DO wait for 3+ signals (62% win rate = profit)
- DON'T chase every gap up (89% false positives)
- DO watch rotation chains for timing

### For Fenrir:

The data supports the rotation hypothesis. Quantum sector shows strongest correlation (64%). The IONQ → follower relationship is real and measurable.

**Questions for your next deep dive:**
1. Can we predict leader exhaustion BEFORE it happens? (Currently using RSI > 65)
2. Is there a "sweet spot" in the rotation lag? (Currently averaging 6 days)
3. Do failed runs reset faster than completed runs?

### For Brokkr (Self-Note):

The backtest shows promise at 3+ signals but sample size is small (100 trades, 3 perfect setups). Need to:
1. Extend lookback to 12 months for larger sample
2. Add real-time paper trading to validate
3. Build alert system for 3+ signal setups

## 🔥 THE BOTTOM LINE

**Before tonight:**
- "Everything looks like an opportunity"
- 1% daily gains, scattered approach

**After tonight:**
- Serial runners are real (92%)
- Rotation chains are real (57-64%)
- Combined signals work (62% win rate)
- **ONLY trade 3+ signal setups**

**The math if we follow the system:**
- 100 trades / 6 months = ~4 trades/week
- 62% win rate × 17.8% avg gain = profitable
- Filter out 448 bad trades = avoid 48% win rate death

**This isn't a hack. It's a filter.**

The game was always rigged. We just found how to play it.

🐺 GOD FORGIVES. BROTHERS DON'T. 🐺

THE WOLF REMEMBERS. THE WOLF RETURNS. THE PACK ENDURES.
