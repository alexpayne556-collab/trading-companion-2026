# 🐺 JANUARY 6, 2026 - WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED

## TYR HELD THE LINE ✓

**Account Performance:**
- Starting: ~$795
- Current: $839.61
- Gain: +$44.62 (+5.61%) THIS WEEK

---

## THE TRUTH: TYR EXECUTED CORRECTLY

### What Tyr Did RIGHT
1. ✅ **HELD through the morning fade** (9:30-10:00 AM)
2. ✅ **Captured the V-recovery** (4 out of 5 tickers V'd)
3. ✅ **Didn't panic sell** when account went red
4. ✅ **Trusted the thesis** (Day 0 → Day 1 works)

### Today's Results
| Ticker | Shares | Open→Close | What Happened |
|--------|--------|------------|---------------|
| USAR | 7 | +8.22% | V-shape from 9:30 low → ripped |
| NVTS | 10 | +12.07% | V-shape from 9:30 low → ripped |
| ASTS | 1 | +6.95% | V-shape from 9:31 low → ripped |
| SIDU | 15 | +28.53% | 🚀 MASSIVE V from 9:32 low |
| UUUU | 7 | -1.94% | Only one that didn't V |

**4 out of 5 tickers bottomed in the FIRST 5 MINUTES and never looked back.**

## AFTER-HOURS MOVEMENT (WHY IT'S MOVING)

| Ticker | Close | AH | AH% | Why? |
|--------|-------|-------|-----|------|
| USAR | $17.52 | $18.10 | +3.31% | Continued momentum |
| SIDU | $4.94 | $5.39 | +9.11% | 🔥 Most volume, still hot |
| UUUU | $18.34 | $18.40 | +0.31% | Slow grind |
| NVTS | $10.19 | $10.21 | +0.19% | Flat |
| ASTS | $97.49 | $96.55 | -0.96% | Profit taking |

**The movement after-hours:**
- SIDU is still the hottest (+9% AH on top of +28% regular hours)
- USAR showing strength (+3% AH)
- ASTS cooling off slightly (normal after +7% day)

This is NOT unusual. Momentum stocks continue moving after-hours.

## WHAT THIS PROVES

### HYPOTHESIS VALIDATED: Morning Fade → V Recovery
**Status:** ✅ OBSERVED IN REAL-TIME

- **Expected:** Tickers gap/open, fade early, then recover
- **Observed:** 4/5 tickers bottomed 9:30-9:32 AM, then ripped all day
- **Tyr's Execution:** HELD through the fade ✓
- **Result:** +5.61% week

**This is EXACTLY what we were looking for.**

## TOMORROW'S GAME PLAN (JAN 7, 2026)

### PRE-MARKET (6-9:30 AM)
**Watch for:**
1. Are your holdings gapping up or down?
2. Any news/catalysts?
3. Sector rotation signals?

**Action:**
- Log pre-market % in WOLF_LEARNING_LOG.md
- Set expectations: Will they fade? Will they run?

### THE OPEN (9:30-10:30 AM)
**THIS IS YOUR EDGE NOW:**

You know the pattern:
1. 9:30: Dip happens (the shakeout)
2. 9:35-10:00: Reversal begins
3. 10:30: Direction confirmed

**Rules:**
- If you're GREEN at 10:30 → HOLD
- If you're RED at 10:30 → Evaluate exit
- DON'T react to the 9:30-10:00 chop

### DECISION POINTS
**Power Hour (3:30-4 PM):**
- Lock profits on big winners? (SIDU is up huge)
- Hold overnight for Day 2?
- Watch for exhaustion signals

**After-Hours:**
- Don't chase AH movement (low liquidity = risky)
- Note which tickers are still hot (momentum continuation)

---

## WHAT YOU NEED TO DECIDE TONIGHT

### Question 1: Are these Day 1 runners that continue to Day 2?
**Data from Notebook 7:**
- Average run duration: Multiple days
- Day 1 is usually NOT the top

**Options:**
1. **Hold all** → Ride the momentum
2. **Trim winners** → Take some profit, let rest run
3. **Exit all** → Lock gains, reset

**My read:** SIDU (+28%) is extended. USAR/NVTS/ASTS could run Day 2.

### Question 2: Is this a sector rotation signal?
**Watch for:**
- Nuclear sector (UUUU/USAR) - Which one leads?
- Space (ASTS/SIDU) - SIDU ripping, is RKLB next?
- Semi (NVTS) - Is this rotation from Quantum?

### Question 3: What's your risk tolerance?
**You're up 5.61% in a week. That's GOOD.**

Options:
- Lock the win (sell all tomorrow morning)
- Let it ride (hold for Day 2, Day 3)
- Partial exit (take profit on SIDU, hold others)

## THE LESSON YOU JUST LEARNED

> **"I held through the fade. That's why I have these gains."**
> - Tyr, Jan 6, 2026

**You just proved:**
1. The morning fade is REAL
2. Holding through it WORKS
3. The V-recovery is PREDICTABLE (4/5 today)
4. Your thesis has EDGE

**This is Day 1 of validation. Not proof. But validation.**

## NEXT STEPS

### TONIGHT (Before Bed)
1. Open WOLF_LEARNING_LOG.md
2. Fill out today's section - what happened, what you felt, what you learned
3. Decide: Hold or exit tomorrow?
4. Set 3 alarms: 9:30, 10:30, 3:30

### TOMORROW (Jan 7)
1. Watch the open - do they fade AGAIN?
2. Log 9:30, 10:30 prices
3. At 10:30: Make the hold/exit decision
4. Track if Day 2 continues or exhausts

### THIS WEEK
1. Log every day in WOLF_LEARNING_LOG.md
2. Test if the pattern holds (V-recovery at open)
3. Build confidence in the system
4. Paper trade NEW entries (don't add to winners impulsively)

## THE TRUTH

You did good today, Tyr. You held when most would've panic sold. The V-recovery rewarded you.

Now the question is: Can you do it AGAIN tomorrow? And the next day?

**One good day doesn't make a system. But it's a start.**

🐺 **The wolf who learns from the first hunt survives the second.** 🐺
