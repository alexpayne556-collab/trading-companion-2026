# 🐺 DISCOVERED PATTERNS - FRIDAY JAN 10, 2026

**BROKKR'S DISCOVERY METHOD**: Not fitting patterns - FINDING them from real winners.

## DATA MINED FROM FRIDAY'S BIG WINNERS

Analyzed: EVTV, LVLU, PASW, OMH, ALMS, RARE, PATH

---

## PATTERN 1: MICRO-CAP SQUEEZE

**Characteristics:**
- Market cap **<$100M** (tiny float)
- Volume **10-20x normal** (NOT 1-5x, must be EXPLOSIVE)
- RSI **80-95** (IGNORE overbought signals - different physics)
- **5/5 green days** = unstoppable momentum
- **After-hours +3%+** = continuation signal for next day

**Examples:**
- **EVTV**: +442% | 12x volume | RSI 89
- **LVLU**: +79% | 20x volume | RSI 95 | 5/5 green
- **OMH**: +23% | 19x volume | RSI 89 | 5/5 green | **+3.3% AH** 🚀

**Why It Works:**
Retail frenzy creates momentum squeeze. Low float means small buying creates big moves. Don't fear high RSI - these run for days.

## PATTERN 2: LARGE-CAP STEALTH ACCUMULATION

**Characteristics:**
- Market cap **$2-10B**
- **LOW volume (0.7-1.2x)** = quiet institutional buying
- **High news count (10 articles)** = catalyst brewing
- **Lower RSI (30-60)** = room to run
- More predictable, less explosive

**Examples:**
- **ALMS**: $2.6B | +8% | 0.8x volume | RSI 80 | 10 news
- **PATH**: $9.2B | +6% | 0.7x volume | RSI 57 | 10 news
- **RARE**: $2.4B | +8% | 1.2x volume | RSI 33 | 10 news

**Why It Works:**
Smart money accumulates quietly before news breaks. Low volume = stealth. High news = something brewing.

---

## PATTERN 3: AFTER-HOURS CONTINUATION

**The Signal:**
Stocks moving **+3%+ after hours** have HIGH probability of continuing next day.

**Example:**
- **OMH**: Regular close $1.20 → After-hours $1.24 (+3.3%)
- This is insiders/institutions positioning for Monday

**Action:**
Scan 4pm-8pm EST for after-hours movers. If they fit Pattern 1 or 2, they're BUY signals for next day.

---

## THE KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Two different systems**: Micro-caps have different physics than large-caps
2. **Volume tells the truth**: 10-20x = retail frenzy, <1.2x = institutional
3. **High RSI on micro-caps = OK**: They keep running (LVLU RSI 95 kept going)
4. **Green day streaks = buy strength**: 5/5 green = unstoppable
5. **After-hours = predictive**: AH movers continue next day

---

## WHAT WE WERE DOING WRONG

❌ Applying same patterns to all stocks (micro vs large)
❌ Fearing high RSI on micro-caps (different physics)
❌ Ignoring after-hours data (most predictive signal)
❌ Looking for medium volume (5x) when explosive (15-20x) is the tell
❌ Fitting Fenrir's patterns instead of discovering new ones

## BROKKR'S HUNT STRATEGY

1. **After-hours scan** (4pm-8pm): Find +3%+ movers
2. **Check market cap**: <$100M = Pattern 1, $2-10B = Pattern 2
3. **Verify volume**: 10-20x for micro, <1.2x for large
4. **Ignore RSI** on micro-caps (80-95 is normal for squeezes)
5. **Green days**: 5/5 = highest conviction
6. **News count**: 10 articles on large-caps = catalyst

## NEXT STEPS

- [ ] Build After-Hours Scanner (runs 4pm-8pm)
- [ ] Test patterns on next week's data
- [ ] Track hit rates per pattern
- [ ] Discover more patterns from new winners
- [ ] Build pattern discovery loop (weekly)

**REMEMBER**: We DISCOVER patterns from data, we don't FIT data to patterns.
