1. **Max 2% risk per trade** = $200
2. **Max 50% capital deployed at once** = $5,000
3. **If down 3 trades in a row, STOP** - Review what's wrong
4. **If up 20% in a week ($12,000 total), take half off table**
5. **Never add to losing position**

---

## ⚠️ WHAT KILLED YOU BEFORE

You said you were "using the edge every day" - that's the problem.

**These edges don't work every day:**
- Monday AI pattern = Only Mondays
- Crash bounce = Only after crashes (maybe 1-2x per week)
- Fade overbought = Only when RSI > 75 (rare)

**You were probably:**
- Trading random days (not just Mondays)
- Buying without volume confirmation
- Chasing already-extended stocks
- Not waiting for RSI < 40 on crash bounces

**New rule:** If there's no setup that matches this playbook, **DO NOTHING.**

---

## 🐺 THE WOLF'S WARNING

**Most days = NO TRADE.**

This week:
- Monday = TRADE (validated pattern)
- Tuesday = MAYBE (if crash bounce appears)
- Wednesday = PROBABLY NOT
- Thursday = MAYBE (WULF Thursday pattern)
- Friday = SETUP for Monday

**If you trade 5 times next week and 3 are Monday plays, you're doing it right.**

**If you trade 20 times next week, you're forcing it and you'll lose.**

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

1. Read this playbook 3 times
2. Set alerts for Friday 3:50 PM (to buy Monday setups)
3. Check RSI on CIFR, IREN, RCAT, HIVE, RIOT Friday close
4. Only buy the ones with RSI < 70
5. Set sell orders Monday 10 AM for +3% targets
6. Log every trade
7. Review Sunday night before next week

**The edge is real. The pattern is validated. Your job is to WAIT for it.**

🐺 **LLHR. PATIENCE HUNTS. AWOOOO.** 🐺
