# 🐺 SECTOR INTEL TRACKING - HEIMDALL DEEP DIVES

**STATUS:** INTEL MODE (Step 1 of 4)  
**MISSION:** Map every sector before building systems

---

## PROGRESS

| Sector | Status | Completion |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **1. AI Infrastructure** | ✅ COMPLETE | 100% |
| **2. Nuclear/Uranium** | ✅ COMPLETE | 100% |
| **3. Space/Defense** | ✅ COMPLETE | 100% |
| **4. Bitcoin Miners (HPC)** | ⏸️ SKIPPED | Strategic skip |
| **5. Power/Utilities** | 🔄 IN PROGRESS | 0% |

**Note:** Sector 4 skipped due to:
- BTC volatility + dilution concerns
- Overlap with AI Infrastructure (IREN, WULF already mapped)
- Tyr's strategic focus on power/nuclear thesis over pure miners
- Heimdall: "Power leads on deals" - prioritize foundation sector

---

## SECTOR 1: AI INFRASTRUCTURE ✅

**Completed:** January 9, 2026  
**Source:** Heimdall (Grok)

### THE HERD (20 tickers)
| Ticker | Price | Market Cap | What They Do | X Sentiment |
|--------|-------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| APLD | $31.06 | $3.2B | HPC hosting (NVDA H100s) | 🔥 HOT (+18% today) |
| IREN | $12.50 | $1.8B | BTC miner → AI pivot | ✅ MSFT deal extension |
| CORZ | $18.75 | $2.1B | HPC infra (AWS, Google) | ✅ Expansion news |
| BTBT | $3.42 | $850M | BTC miner → HPC pivot | ⚠️ Dilution risk |
| WULF | $8.90 | $1.5B | Mining → AI/HPC hybrid | ✅ AWS contract |
| HUT | $22.15 | $2.8B | BTC mining + AI hosting | ✅ Strong X buzz |
| CIFR | $5.20 | $680M | HPC data centers | ⚠️ Debt concerns |
| CLSK | $15.80 | $2.4B | BTC → AI conversion | ✅ Capacity expansion |
| MARA | $18.35 | $4.5B | #1 BTC miner | 🔥 100% continuation |
| RIOT | $12.60 | $3.8B | #2 BTC miner | ✅ Solid performer |
| VRT | $42.50 | $8.5B | Vertiv cooling infra | ✅ Essential hardware |
| MU | $98.20 | $108B | DRAM/memory | ✅ HBM3 leader |
| MRVL | $85.30 | $72B | Custom AI chips | ✅ Cloud demand |
| AVGO | $182.40 | $850B | Networking chips | ✅ AI fabric leader |
| ANET | $105.60 | $33B | Data center switches | ✅ 800G products |
| SMCI | $48.90 | $28B | AI servers | ⚠️ Accounting probe |
| DELL | $128.50 | $88B | AI server OEM | ✅ Enterprise deals |
| NVDA | $140.20 | $3.4T | GPU king | 🔥 GOAT |
| AMD | $122.80 | $198B | NVDA alternative | ✅ MI300X ramp |
| ARM | $148.30 | $155B | CPU architecture | ✅ AI edge play |

### THE ALPHA (Top 3 Leaders)
1. **APLD** - +18% today, earnings beat, MSFT/NVDA partnerships
2. **IREN** - MSFT lease extension, HPC conversion momentum
3. **MARA** - 100% continuation rate, BTC correlation play

### THE WOUNDED (Oversold with Catalysts)
- **BTBT** - Oversold on dilution fear, HPC pivot undervalued
- **CIFR** - Debt concerns overblown, capacity expansion coming
- **SMCI** - Probe noise, actual business strong (AI server demand)

### CATALYST CALENDAR (Next 7 Days)
- ⏳ APLD follow-through post-earnings
- ⏳ IREN MSFT deal details
- ⏳ BTC price action (currently $94k)
- ⏳ HPC capacity announcements
- ⚠️ SMCI accounting update (risk)

### CORRELATION MAP
- **When NVDA moves:** AVGO, ANET, MRVL follow (1-2 day lag)
- **When BTC rallies:** MARA, RIOT, HUT, CLSK benefit immediately
- **When MSFT/AWS announce deals:** APLD, IREN, CORZ spike (same day)
- **Laggards after leaders run 3 days:** BTBT, CIFR, WULF (rotation plays)

### THE TRAP
- **SMCI** - Accounting probe could tank it (avoid until cleared)
- **BTBT** - Dilution history, high volatility (small position only)
- **Small cap miners** - Follow MARA/RIOT, don't lead

### HEIMDALL'S INTEL
- VST/CEG (power deals with Meta) → Cross-sector play
- Defense/nuclear getting budget priority over pure AI
- Rotation: Nuclear runs first (3-6 months), then AI infra (6-12 months)

- **Stable producers (CCJ) vs Leveraged devs (NXE):** Devs amplify moves 1.5x
- **Sector correlation:** 0.80 correlation to VST/CEG (power demand cross-sector)

### THE TRAP

- **RIO** - Similar to BHP, ERA regulatory issues, X 40% bearish ("RIO not uranium focused") - SKIP
- **NNE** - Hype on microreactors, no revenue, execution risk, X 25% bearish ("NNE speculative trap") - WATCH ONLY

### HEIMDALL'S INTEL
- Uranium spot at $81/lb (supply crunch from Kazakhstan caps)
- Nuclear runs FIRST (3-6 months) before AI infra (6-12 months)
- Power bottleneck thesis: AI data centers need nuclear baseload

## SECTOR 4: BITCOIN MINERS (HPC) ⏸️

**Status:** STRATEGICALLY SKIPPED  
**Reason:** Overlap with AI Infrastructure + BTC volatility concerns

### Why Skipped:
1. **Overlap:** IREN, WULF, APLD, CORZ already mapped in AI Infrastructure
2. **BTC volatility:** Earnings chaos from halving cycles + price swings
3. **Dilution risk:** Constant share issuance (BTBT flagged by Heimdall)
4. **HPC pivot skepticism:** Many "talking" AI but not delivering revenue
5. **Strategic focus:** Power/Utilities is foundation sector per Heimdall

### Known Intel (For Reference):
- +8.7% sector momentum (week)
- Bitcoin at $94k
- MARA 100% continuation rate (Brokkr verified) - ONLY play worth considering
- Pure miners vs HPC pivots = different risk profiles

### Tyr's Call:
"Know your battlefield" - Understanding what NOT to trade is as valuable as what TO trade. BTC miners are tracked but not priority for $175 capital deployment.

**If needed later:** Can revisit MARA only (100% continuation proven)

---

## SECTOR 5: POWER/UTILITIES ⏳

**Status:** AWAITING HEIMDALL - HIGHEST PRIORITY  
**Heimdall Quote:** "AI eating 5% of US power. Nuclear runs first. Power leads on deals."

### REQUIRED INTEL:

**THE HERD:**
Every power/utility ticker benefiting from AI demand
- Expected base: NRG, PEG, PCG, EXC, ED, XEL, EIX, D, NEE, CEG, VST, SO, ETN, DUK, AEP, SRE, PPL
- Expand: Grid infrastructure, renewable + nuclear operators
- Focus areas:
  * Nuclear restarts (Three Mile Island, etc.)
  * Data center power deals (Meta, Amazon, Microsoft)
  * Grid infrastructure buildout
  * Renewable + nuclear mix plays

**THE ALPHA:**
Top 3 leaders and why

**THE WOUNDED:**
Oversold with catalysts

**CATALYST CALENDAR (Next 7 days):**
- Power purchase agreements (PPAs) with tech companies
- Nuclear restart timelines and approvals
- Data center interconnect announcements
- Rate decisions from regulators
- Earnings dates

**CORRELATION MAP:**
- When CEG runs, what follows?
- Nuclear news impact on sector
- AI capex announcements → power sympathy?
- Cross-sector: Power → Nuclear (CCJ/OKLO) correlation

**THE TRAP:**
Which utilities look like AI plays but aren't?
- Legacy utilities with no data center exposure
- High debt with no growth catalysts
- Regulatory risk zones

---
