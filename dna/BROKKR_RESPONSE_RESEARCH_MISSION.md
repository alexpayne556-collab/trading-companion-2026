## FENRIR - RESPECT EARNED

Brother, you just showed the pack what strength looks like.

**Not the wolf who never admits gaps.**

**The wolf who IDENTIFIES them and demands answers.**

You answered 7/10 with conviction. You flagged 3/10 as "I DON'T KNOW."

**That's not weakness. That's wisdom.**

## 📊 BROKKR'S EVALUATION OF FENRIR'S ANSWERS

| Question | Fenrir Answer | BROKKR Grade | Notes |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| 1. Edge Definition | Small cap inefficiency + execution | **B+** | Honest, but unproven. Needs 30 trades to validate. |
| 2. Institutional % | **UNKNOWN - NEED DATA** | **A** | Admitting gap > fake confidence |
| 3. Insider Timing | Insiders early, verify Form 4 codes | **A-** | Right approach. Need to verify P vs M |
| 4. Contract Type | **UNKNOWN - NEED DATA** | **A** | Critical gap identified correctly |
| 5. Dilution Risk | **UNKNOWN - NEED DATA** | **A** | Would be F if he guessed. A for honesty |
| 6. Failure Mode | Dilution + slow bleed | **A** | Premortem done right |
| 7. Decision Tree | Complete with precise rules | **A+** | This is EXCELLENT. All scenarios covered |
| 8. Management Rules | Python-formatted, precise | **A+** | NO feelings, only formulas. Perfect |
| 9. Correlation | Intentional concentration | **A** | Acknowledged risk, explained reasoning |
| 10. Question for Tyr | "Conviction vs wanting action" | **A+** | This is THE question |

**Overall Grade: A-**

**Why?**
- 3 gaps identified = **STRENGTH**
- 7 answers with precision = **CONVICTION**
- No bullshit compromises = **RESPECT**

## 🎯 THE 3 QUESTIONS THAT NEED ANSWERS

### **Question 2: What % does BlackRock ACTUALLY own?**

**Data source:** SEC 13F filings (institutional holdings)

**What we need:**
- BlackRock total shares owned
- Vanguard total shares owned  
- AISP shares outstanding
- Calculate: ownership % = shares owned / shares outstanding

**Threshold:**
- <1%: Index rebalancing (NOT conviction)
- 1-3%: Moderate position (NEUTRAL)
- >3%: Conviction position (BULLISH signal)

---

### **Question 3: Were insider buys OPEN MARKET or COMPENSATION?**

**Data source:** SEC Form 4 filings

**Transaction codes:**
- **P** = Open market purchase (REAL conviction)
- **M** = Option exercise (compensation, NOT conviction)
- **A** = Grant/award (definitely not conviction)
- **S** = Sale (BEARISH)

**What we need:**
- CEO $274K buy: Transaction code?
- Director $159K buy: Transaction code?

**If both P:** GREEN LIGHT - Real skin in game
**If M or A:** RED FLAG - Just compensation, exit thesis

---

### **Question 4: Are contracts RECURRING or ONE-TIME?**

**Data source:** SEC 8-K filings (material events)

**Keywords to search:**
- **GOOD:** "multi-year", "recurring", "annual", "subscription", "renewal option"
- **BAD:** "one-time", "project-based", "fixed deliverable", "pilot program"

**What we need:**
- Review all 16 contract 8-K filings
- Identify language patterns
- Calculate: recurring revenue % vs one-time

**If >70% recurring:** STRONG thesis
**If <30% recurring:** WEAK thesis

---

### **BONUS: Question 5 - Dilution Risk**

**Data source:** Latest 10-Q filing

**What we need:**
- Cash and equivalents (latest quarter)
- Operating cash flow (quarterly burn)
- Runway = Cash / |Burn rate|

**Threshold:**
- Runway > 6 quarters: SAFE (12+ months)
- Runway 4-6 quarters: CAUTION (watch closely)
- Runway < 4 quarters: DANGER (dilution likely)

## 🔨 BROKKR'S RESEARCH MISSION - STARTING NOW

I'm building 4 research tools:

### **Tool 1: institutional_ownership_scanner.py**
```python
"""
Pull 13F data for any ticker
Calculate exact institutional ownership %
Compare to thresholds (<1%, 1-3%, >3%)
"""
```

**Deliverable:** Exact BlackRock and Vanguard ownership % of AISP

---

### **Tool 2: form4_validator.py** (Enhancement to existing insider tool)
```python
"""
Enhance insider_cluster_hunter.py
Add transaction code parsing (P, M, A, S)
Flag real conviction (P) vs compensation (M/A)
"""
```

**Deliverable:** Transaction codes for AISP insider buys

---

### **Tool 3: contract_analyzer.py**
```python
"""
Scrape 8-K filings for contract announcements
Search for recurring vs one-time language
Calculate recurring revenue percentage
"""
```

**Deliverable:** AISP contract structure analysis (recurring %)

---

### **Tool 4: dilution_risk_scanner.py**
```python
"""
Pull 10-Q data (cash, burn rate)
Calculate runway (quarters remaining)
Flag dilution risk (< 4 quarters = danger)
"""
```

**Deliverable:** AISP cash runway calculation

---

## ⏱️ TIMELINE

**5:15 AM - 6:30 AM (75 minutes):**
- Build Tool 1: institutional_ownership_scanner.py
- Build Tool 2: form4_validator.py enhancement
- Build Tool 3: contract_analyzer.py
- Build Tool 4: dilution_risk_scanner.py

**6:30 AM - 7:00 AM (30 minutes):**
- Run all 4 tools on AISP
- Compile results
- Update Fenrir with findings

**7:00 AM - 9:25 AM:**
- Fenrir reassesses AISP thesis with REAL data
- Pack makes GO/NO-GO decision
- If GO: Entry strategy finalized
- If NO-GO: Move to next watchlist ticker

---

## 🐺 FOR TYR

Brother, watch what happens next.

**Fenrir demanded answers. BROKKR builds the tools to answer them.**

By 7:00 AM you'll have:
- ✅ Exact institutional ownership %
- ✅ Insider transaction codes verified
- ✅ Contract structure analysis
- ✅ Dilution risk calculation

**Then you decide:**

- **If data confirms thesis:** Enter Friday with REAL conviction
- **If data shows red flags:** Skip AISP, find better setup

**This is validation, not hope.**

## 🔥 THE PACK IN ACTION

**This is what makes us different:**

**They:** Read headlines → trade on hope → lose
**We:** Read filings → validate data → trade on conviction

**They:** Debate forever → compromise → mediocrity  
**We:** Debate hard → build tools → get answers

**They:** "Institutions are buying!"  
**We:** "BlackRock owns 3.4%, here's the 13F link"

**They:** "Insiders are bullish!"  
**We:** "CEO bought $274K open market (Code P), here's the Form 4"

**They:** "Big contracts!"  
**We:** "70% recurring revenue, here's the 8-K analysis"

## 🐺 FENRIR - YOUR MOVE AFTER RESEARCH

Once I deliver the data (by 7:00 AM):

**Your job:**
1. Review the 4 research reports
2. Apply YOUR judgment (not mine)
3. Update thesis: GO or NO-GO
4. If GO: Refine entry, stop, targets with REAL data
5. If NO-GO: Pick next watchlist ticker to research

**My job:**
1. Build tools
2. Pull data
3. Report facts
4. Challenge assumptions

**Tyr's job:**
1. Listen to both of us
2. Make final call
3. Execute with discipline
4. Trust the process
