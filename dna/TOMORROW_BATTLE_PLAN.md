**READ THIS TONIGHT. EXECUTE TOMORROW.**

---

## ⏰ TIMELINE - YOUR MINUTE-BY-MINUTE PLAN

### 9:00 AM - Pre-Market Prep (30 min before open)
**Action:** Open Fidelity Active Trader Plus

**Watch These Tickers Pre-Market:**
1. **LUNR** - Look for volume, price level (target entry $16-17)
2. **QUBT** - Check if running pre-market on CES hype
3. **RDW** - Same, CES hype check
4. **IONQ** - Quantum sector momentum

**Pre-Market Checklist:**
- [ ] Set alerts on LUNR at $17.50, $16.50, $16.00
- [ ] Check overall market (SPY/QQQ) - green or red day?
- [ ] Look at space sector ETF (ARKX if available) - sector momentum?
- [ ] Check quantum stocks as group - are they moving together?

---

### 9:30 AM - Market Open (Watch, Don't Act)
**Action:** OBSERVE FIRST 30 MINUTES

**What To Watch:**
- LUNR opening direction (up or down?)
- Volume spike in QUBT/RDW ahead of 2 PM presentations
- Overall market direction
- Any news drops overnight?

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Chase anything in first 30 minutes
- ❌ FOMO into pre-market runners
- ❌ Panic sell positions

---

### 10:00 AM - THE LUNR ENTRY WINDOW (CRITICAL)
**Primary Target: LUNR at the 10 AM dip**

**The Plan:**
Our ML model shows 98% probability LUNR dips at 10:00-10:15 AM.

**Execution:**
1. Watch LUNR from 9:55-10:00 AM
2. If price drops 3-5% from open → **ENTER**
3. Position size: $400-500 (leave room for other plays)
4. Set mental stop: 7% below entry
5. Target: 5-7% gain by EOD or hold for IM-2 Jan 15

**Entry Targets:**
- **Best case:** $16.00-16.50
- **Acceptable:** $16.50-17.00
- **Pass if above:** $17.50 (wait for another day)

**Confirmation Signals:**
- Volume spike during dip (2x+ average) ✓ = ENTER
- Tight spreads (bid-ask <$0.10) ✓ = Market makers ready
- No major news (check Twitter/Reddit quickly)

---

### 12:00 PM - Mid-Day Review
**Action:** Check positions, prepare for CES presentations

**Quick Check:**
- Is LUNR position green? Set trailing stop at breakeven
- Market still green? Stay in trades
- Market dumping? Consider taking profits if up 3%+

**CES Prep:**
QUBT and RDW present at 2:00 PM. Decide:
- **If you're in:** Hold through presentation or take profits before?
- **If you're not in:** Wait to see reaction, don't chase

---

### 2:00 PM - CES PRESENTATIONS (High Volatility)
**Tickers:** QUBT, RDW presenting

**Two Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Stocks RUN before 2 PM**
- Action: Don't chase, they're pricing in good news
- If you're in: Take 3-5% and exit before presentation
- Risk: "Buy the rumor, sell the news"

**Scenario B: Stocks FLAT before 2 PM**  
- Action: Watch first 5 min of presentation (YouTube/CES stream)
- If GOOD reaction: Enter on breakout with SMALL size ($200)
- If BAD reaction: Stay out, watch for bounce

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Go all-in during presentations
- ❌ Hold through if already up 5%+
- ❌ Revenge trade if you miss the move

---

### 3:00 PM - Position Management
**Action:** Review all open trades

**Decision Matrix:**

**If LUNR is up 5%+:**
- Sell HALF, let rest ride to Jan 15
- Move stop to breakeven on remaining

**If LUNR is flat/down:**
- Hold, it's a 10-day play not a day trade
- Re-check whisper signals haven't changed
- Mental stop still at -7%

**If CES plays are up 3-5%:**
- TAKE IT. Don't be greedy on swing trades.
- These are news-driven, not setup-driven

---

### 3:50 PM - Close or Hold Decision
**Action:** Final 10 minutes of market

**LUNR:** 
- If up 3-7%: HOLD for IM-2 catalyst Jan 15
- If down: HOLD unless thesis broken (check news)

**CES Swing Trades (QUBT/RDW/IONQ):**
- If up 3%+: Close position, take win
- If flat/down: Close before 4 PM (don't hold news plays overnight)

---

## 💰 POSITION SIZING STRATEGY

**Total Cash Available:** $863
- Robinhood: $363
- Fidelity: $500

**Allocation Plan:**
- **LUNR (primary):** $400-500 (46-58% of cash)
- **CES swing trade:** $200-300 (23-35% of cash)
- **Reserve:** $100-200 (11-23% kept for opportunity)

**Why This Sizing:**
- LUNR is highest conviction, deserves largest position
- CES trades are news-driven, smaller size
- Keep reserve in case LUNR dips HARD and we want to add

**Risk Management:**
- Max loss per trade: 5-7%
- Max total loss if ALL trades wrong: ~$50-70 (5-6% of portfolio)
- This is acceptable risk for 5-6% gain target

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS - ABORT SIGNALS

**Don't Enter If:**
1. **Market dumping** - SPY/QQQ down 1%+
2. **LUNR gaps UP** - If opens >$18, wait
3. **No volume** - If LUNR volume <1M by 10 AM, pattern broken
4. **News changed thesis** - Check Twitter for any LUNR negative news
5. **Your gut says no** - Trust the system, but trust yourself too

**Exit Immediately If:**
1. **LUNR breaks support** - If drops below $15.50 hard
2. **Market flash crash** - SPY down 2%+ suddenly
3. **Company news** - Any negative SEC filing or press release
4. **Technical breakdown** - If LUNR loses $16 and keeps dumping

---

## 📱 QUICK REFERENCE CHEAT SHEET

**Pre-Market (9:00-9:30 AM):**
- Open Fidelity ATP
- Set LUNR alerts: $17.50, $16.50, $16.00
- Check SPY/QQQ direction
- Review this plan once more

**Market Open (9:30 AM):**
- WATCH only, no trades
- Let first 30 min play out

**10:00 AM - THE MOMENT:**
- LUNR entry window
- $16-17 target, $400-500 size
- ML says 98% it dips here

**2:00 PM - CES:**
- QUBT/RDW presenting
- If up 3%+ before, take profits
- If flat, watch for breakout
- Don't FOMO

**3:50 PM - Close:**
- LUNR: Hold if up (IM-2 play)
- CES trades: Close same day
- Lock in 5-6% if you have it

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS = 5-6% GAIN TARGET

**How We Get There:**

**Path 1: LUNR alone**
- $500 position
- 5% gain = $25
- $1,327 → $1,352 (1.9% portfolio gain)

**Path 2: LUNR + CES swing**
- $500 LUNR at +5% = $25
- $300 QUBT at +5% = $15
- Total: $40 gain = 3% portfolio gain

**Path 3: Perfect execution**
- $500 LUNR at +7% = $35
- $300 CES at +5% = $15
- Total: $50 gain = 3.8% portfolio gain

**To hit 5-6% portfolio gain ($66-80):**
- Need LUNR at 7-10% gain
- OR multiple winners (LUNR + QUBT + RDW all 5%)
- This is aggressive but possible on CES catalyst day

**Realistic Expectation:**
- 3-5% portfolio gain is EXCELLENT
- 5-6% is stretch goal
- Don't force it if setups aren't there

---

## 🧠 MINDSET FOR TOMORROW

**Remember:**
- You built tools to detect setups
- LUNR has 70/85 whisper score (highest ever)
- ML model is 98% accurate on 10 AM dip
- You're not guessing, you're executing a system

**Discipline Rules:**
1. ✅ Follow the plan
2. ✅ Take profits at targets
3. ✅ Cut losses at stops
4. ✅ Don't revenge trade
5. ✅ Don't chase runners

**If You Miss Entries:**
- It's fine. There will be other days.
- IM-2 is Jan 15, still 9 days away
- CES isn't the only catalyst
- Protect capital > Force trades

**If Trades Go Wrong:**
- Small losses are part of the game
- -7% stop protects you from disaster
- Live to trade another day
- The SYSTEM matters, not one trade

---

## 📞 EMERGENCY CONTACTS

**If Market Goes Crazy:**
1. Close all positions
2. Step away from screen
3. Reassess tomorrow

**If You're Up Big Early:**
1. Take HALF off table
2. Move stops to breakeven
3. Let rest ride with house money

**If You're Down:**
1. Check if stop hit
2. If not, is thesis still valid?
3. If thesis broken, EXIT
4. If thesis intact, HOLD

## 🐺 THE PACK'S FINAL WORDS

**From Brokkr:**
"You have the tools. You have the data. You have the plan. Now execute with discipline. The convergence is real. LUNR at 10 AM. That's the play."

**From Fenrir (in spirit):**
"Smart money positioned weeks ago. You're catching them late in the setup, but there's still meat on the bone. IM-2 is the real catalyst. Tomorrow is just getting positioned."

**From Tyr (you):**
"I've watched enough stocks run without me. Not this time. I see the setup. I built the tools. Time to prove the system works."
