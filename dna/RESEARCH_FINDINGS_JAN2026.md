# 🐺 BROKKR RESEARCH LAB - COMPLETE FINDINGS
## January 10, 2026 | For Fenrir Review

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Data Analyzed:** 67 tickers, 4,221 data points, 3-month period (Oct 2025 - Jan 2026)

**Key Discovery:** Winners come from PULLBACKS, not breakouts. The "buy dips" wisdom is VALIDATED.

## VALIDATED EDGES (USE THESE)

### 1. RSI OVERSOLD EDGE ✅
```
RSI < 30:
  - 5-day forward return: +1.96% (vs -1.03% baseline)
  - Win rate: 52.2%
  - Edge over baseline: +3.00%
  - Sample size: 670 events

RSI > 70 (SELL SIGNAL):
  - 5-day forward return: -6.61%
  - Win rate: 16.5%
  - VERDICT: Overbought = SELL
```

### 2. DISTANCE FROM HIGH (BUY ZONE) ✅
```
OPTIMAL BUY ZONES:
  -20% to -30% from high: +2.82% avg, 52.6% win rate (n=538)
  -30% to -40% from high: +2.04% avg, 51.3% win rate (n=458)
  -10% to -20% from high: +1.98% avg, 48.2% win rate (n=818)

  Destroyed (-50%+): -4.50% avg, 38.0% win rate
```

### 3. COMBINED SIGNAL SCORE ✅
```
Scoring System (0-8 points):
  +1 if RSI < 40
  +1 if RSI < 30
  +1 if down 10%+ from high
  +1 if down 20%+ from high
  +1 if past 5d was negative (buying weakness)
  +1 if volume normal (< 1.5x)
  +1 if Monday or Friday

  - Next 5-day return: +3.57%
  - Win rate: 53.9%
  - Sample size: 293 events
  
INTERPRETATION: Calm before the storm - coiling for a move
```

```

---

## PATTERNS TO AVOID (DESTROYERS)

### 1. VOLUME SPIKES = EXHAUSTION ❌
```
Volume > 2x average:
  - UP day + volume spike: -5.67% next 5 days
  - DOWN day + volume spike: -9.69% next 5 days

Volume magnitude:
  Vol > 1.5x: -1.47% next 5d
  Vol > 2.0x: -7.25% next 5d
  Vol > 3.0x: -13.38% next 5d (13.3% win rate!)

VERDICT: High volume = EXIT SIGNAL, not entry
```

### 2. CHASING MOMENTUM = LOSING ❌
```
After stock UP in past 5 days:
  +5%:  next 5d -2.21%, 30.9% win rate
  +10%: next 5d -3.21%, 26.7% win rate
  +15%: next 5d -3.58%, 24.7% win rate
  +20%: next 5d -4.43%, 22.1% win rate
  +30%: next 5d -5.03%, 17.5% win rate

VERDICT: Never chase. The bigger the run, the worse the entry.
```

### 3. GAP UPS = FADE ❌
```
Gap up > 3%: intraday -0.88%, 5d return -2.90%
Gap up > 5%: intraday -1.72%, 5d return -3.34%
Gap up > 10%: intraday -2.12%
Gap up > 15%: 5d return -6.59%

VERDICT: Sell into gap ups, don't buy them
```

### 4. OVEREXTENSION FROM SMA ❌
```
20%+ ABOVE SMA20: -6.50% next 5 days
20%+ BELOW SMA20: +0.37% next 5 days (slight edge)

VERDICT: Extended stocks mean revert hard
```

### 5. MONDAY AFTER HOT WEEKS ❌
```
Monday after +10% week: -1.19% avg return

VERDICT: Don't FOMO into Monday opens after big weeks
```

## HIDDEN PATTERNS (What Humans Miss)

### 1. Volume Exhaustion
```
+15% move on DECLINING volume: +0.61% next 5d
+15% move on INCREASING volume: -5.82% next 5d

INSIGHT: Big moves on declining volume are healthier
         Big moves on increasing volume = exhaustion
```

### 2. Consecutive Days
```
After 3+ green days: -0.69% next day
After 3+ red days: -0.60% next day

INSIGHT: Streaks continue more than expected (slight)
```

## THE SCANNER CRITERIA

### BUY SIGNAL (All must be true)
```python
def is_buy_signal(row):
    return (
        row['rsi'] < 40 and                    # Oversold
        row['dist_from_20d_high'] < -0.15 and  # Down 15%+ from high
        row['vol_ratio'] < 1.5 and             # Normal volume
        row['ret_5d_past'] < 0                 # Coming from weakness
    )
```

### SELL SIGNAL (Any triggers exit)
```python
def is_sell_signal(row):
    return (
        row['rsi'] > 70 or                     # Overbought
        row['vol_ratio'] > 2.0 or              # Volume exhaustion
        row['dist_from_20d_high'] > -0.05      # Near highs
    )
```

### OPTIMAL ENTRY SCORE
```python
def entry_score(row):
    score = 0
    if row['rsi'] < 40: score += 1
    if row['rsi'] < 30: score += 1
    if row['dist_from_20d_high'] < -0.10: score += 1
    if row['dist_from_20d_high'] < -0.20: score += 1
    if row['ret_5d_past'] < 0: score += 1
    if row['vol_ratio'] < 1.5: score += 1
    if row['is_monday'] or row['is_friday']: score += 1
    if row['volatility_10d'] < row['volatility_20d'] * 0.7: score += 1
    return score
    
# Score 4+ = HIGH CONVICTION ENTRY
```

## ACTIONABLE PLAYBOOK

### Entry Rules
1. **Wait for RSI < 40** - Don't buy overbought
2. **Buy 20-30% below highs** - The sweet spot
3. **Prefer Friday/Monday** - Best days statistically
4. **Check for volatility contraction** - Calm before storm
5. **Stack signals** - Score 4+ before entry

### Exit Rules
1. **Sell on volume spike (2x+)** - Exhaustion signal
2. **Fade gap ups** - Take profits on 5%+ gaps
3. **Exit at RSI > 70** - Overbought
4. **Don't hold through Thursday** - Worst day
5. **Exit when 20%+ above SMA20** - Extended

### Position Sizing
1. **Score 5+**: Full position
2. **Score 4**: 75% position
3. **Score 3**: 50% position
4. **Score 0-2**: No entry

### Sector Strategy
1. **QUANTUM/CANNABIS**: Play sympathy (0.87/0.79 correlation)
2. **SPACE**: High correlation (0.68), most +20% producers
3. **DEFENSE**: Independent - trade on own merits

---

## CURRENT HOLDINGS ANALYSIS

### APLD ✅
- High volatility producer (12 big moves in 3 months)
- Just had +18% on Jan 9 (hyperscaler deal)
- Now likely extended - watch for pullback entry

### KTOS ✅
- Defense sector (lower correlation)
- Need to check current setup vs criteria

### TLRY ✅
- Cannabis (high correlation 0.79)
- +7% AH on earnings
- Sympathy plays work in this sector

### NTLA ✅
- Biotech (0.57 correlation)
- Need to check current RSI/distance from high

---

## NEXT STEPS FOR FENRIR

1. **Build real-time scanner** using these criteria
2. **Backtest the combined signal score** on longer timeframe
3. **Add catalyst layer** (earnings, upgrades) on top of technicals
4. **Research sector rotation patterns** - when does leadership shift?
5. **Test the Monday-after-big-week fade** as a strategy
