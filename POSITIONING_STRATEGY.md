# 🐺 TYR'S POSITIONING STRATEGY
## Position Before the Wave - Not Chase It

**Date:** January 6, 2026  
**Philosophy:** Let the wave pick us up, not we catch it

---

## THE REALIZATION 💡

**Tyr said:**
> "I want to be well positioned before the wave comes. Let the wave pick us up, not we catch it."

**This is EXACTLY how smart money operates.**

---

## THE TWO STRATEGIES (Compared)

### ❌ CHASING (What Retail Does)
```
Day 1: News breaks → Stock gaps 15% → FOMO buying
Day 2: +20% total → "I can't miss this!" → Buy high
Day 3: Dumps -10% → Panic sell → Loss
```

### ✅ POSITIONING (What Smart Money Does)
```
Day 1: Scanner finds unusual activity → Buy quietly at $10
Day 2: Price flat/slight dip → Hold conviction (thesis intact)
Day 3: Catalyst hits → Stock gaps to $13 → Sell into THEIR buying
```

**You want to BE strategy #2.**

---

## YOUR TRACK RECORD (Proof It Works)

### USAR - POSITIONED EARLY ✅
- **Entry:** Monday 11:30 AM at ~$14.15 (after initial run)
- **Catalyst:** Venezuela invasion Jan 3 (already happening)
- **Result:** +12% so far
- **Lesson:** Even though you bought after initial move, the BIG catalyst (Maduro captured) hadn't fully played out yet
- **Grade:** B+ (good, but could've been earlier)

### QUBT - TOO LATE ⚠️
- **Entry:** Considering Tuesday morning
- **Catalyst:** CES demo Tuesday 2-4 PM (TODAY)
- **Problem:** Catalyst is 6 hours away, already ran +1.27% Monday
- **Smart money:** Bought last week when options flow lit up
- **Grade:** C- (you're buying what they're selling into)

---

## THE EARLY POSITIONING FRAMEWORK

### STEP 1: FIND PLAYS 2-7 DAYS BEFORE CATALYST

**Use these tools:**
```bash
# Morning hunt (6:30 AM daily)
./morning_hunt.sh

# Manually check:
python3 pre_catalyst_hunter.py --days 7 --min-score 5
python3 options_flow_scanner.py
python3 form4_conviction_scanner.py
```

**What you're looking for:**
- ✅ Known catalyst 2-7 days away (CES, earnings, FDA, etc.)
- ✅ Unusual options activity NOW (smart money positioning)
- ✅ Price hasn't run yet (still under 5% gain in last week)
- ✅ Sector rotation showing strength
- ✅ Low volume accumulation (quiet buying)

**Red flags (don't chase):**
- ❌ Catalyst is TODAY (too late)
- ❌ Already ran 10%+ (smart money already positioned)
- ❌ High volume spike (retail FOMO)
- ❌ No clear catalyst date (just hype)

---

## STEP 2: VALIDATE WITH CONFLUENCE

**Need 3+ signals:**
1. Scanner signal (options flow / Form 4 / 8-K)
2. Sector rotation (sector is hot)
3. Known catalyst with DATE
4. Pattern analysis (doesn't dump on news)

**If only 1-2 signals → WAIT**

---

## STEP 3: POSITION SIZING (Early = Larger Size)

Because you're early, you can afford to be BIGGER:

**Early positioning (2-7 days before):**
- Size: 15-20% of account ($200-265 from $1,327)
- Why: Lower risk (not chasing), more time to be right
- Stop: -10% (mental)
- Target: +20-30% (sell into catalyst)

**Late positioning (day of):**
- Size: 5-10% of account ($65-130)
- Why: Higher risk (already running)
- Stop: -7% (tighter)
- Target: +10-15% (quick flip)

**Chasing after run:**
- Size: 0% (don't do it)
- Why: You're exit liquidity

---

## STEP 4: HOLD THROUGH THE NOISE

**This is the HARDEST part:**

You buy Monday at $10.  
Tuesday it dips to $9.50 (-5%).  
**DO YOU PANIC?**

**NO. You ask:**
1. Is the thesis intact? (Catalyst still happening?)
2. Did scanner signals disappear? (Or still there?)
3. Is the sector still hot? (Or rotating out?)

**If YES, YES, YES → HOLD.**  
**If NO to any → EXIT.**

**Example with USAR:**
- Bought Monday $14.15
- If it dipped to $13.50 Tuesday (-4.6%)
- Thesis check: Venezuela still happening? YES
- Scanners: Rare earth sector still #5? YES
- Action: **HOLD** (let the wave form)

---

## STEP 5: SELL INTO STRENGTH (Not Weakness)

**The day of the catalyst:**

```
9:30 AM:  Opens +10% (now $11 → $12.10)
10:00 AM: Retail piles in, hits $13 (+30%)
2:00 PM:  Catalyst event happens, spikes to $14 (+40%)
3:00 PM:  Profit-taking starts, drops to $13.50

WHERE DO YOU SELL?
```

**Your ladder:**
- **50% at +20%:** Sell at $13.20 (lock in gains)
- **25% at +30%:** Sell at $14.30 (let it run)
- **25% trail stop:** At high -10% = $12.60

**This way:**
- You LOCK IN gains early (reduce risk)
- You PARTICIPATE in the squeeze (if it runs)
- You DON'T give it all back (trail stop)

- Available: $873 (66% cash)
- Deploy $200-300 when you find EARLY play

### OPTION B: TEST QUBT WITH SMALL SIZE ⚠️ (COMPROMISE)

**Why:**
- Learn from the experience

- Small enough to not hurt

**Action:**
- Buy $50-75 QUBT at 9:30 AM (Robinhood)
- Target: $13.50 (+13%) during demo
- Stop: $10.50 (-12%)
- Treat as EDUCATION, not conviction trade

**This teaches you:**

### OPTION C: HOLD CASH, WAIT FOR EARLY PLAY 🐺 (PATIENT WOLF)

**Why:**
- Nothing good is EARLY right now
- CES is ending this week
- Next catalyst wave: earnings (starts in 2 weeks)

**Action:**
- Hold all cash
- Run scanners daily
- Build catalyst calendar for next 2 weeks
- POUNCE when you find early play

## THE CATALYST CALENDAR (Fenrir's Job)

**Next 2 weeks - What's coming?**

| DATE | EVENT | TICKERS | STATUS |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| Jan 7 (Tue) | CES Quantum | QBTS | ❌ Already ran |
| Jan 8 (Wed) | CES Lunar | LUNR, RDW | ❌ Already ran |
| Jan 9 (Thu) | CES Ends | - | - |
| Jan 13-17 | Earnings Start | TBD | 🔍 Research needed |
| Jan 20 (Mon) | Inauguration | USAR? | 🔍 Watch rare earth |

**Fenrir needs to:**
1. Find earnings dates for hot sectors (Quantum, Nuclear, Space)
2. Find FDA calendar (biotech plays)
3. Find contract announcements (defense, space)
4. Update pre_catalyst_hunter.py with dates

---

## THE PERFECT TRADE (Template)

**Day -5 to -2 (Early Positioning):**
- Scanner finds unusual options activity
- Stock is flat/slight up (+2-5%)
- Known catalyst in 2-5 days
- Buy $200-265 (15-20% of account)

**Day -1 (Quiet Hold):**
- Price dips 3-5% (shake weak hands)
- You hold conviction (thesis intact)
- Smart money still accumulating

**Day 0 (Catalyst Day):**
- Stock gaps +10% at open
- Retail piles in after news
- You sell 50% at +20% (lock gains)
- Let 25% run to +30%
- Trail stop 25% at high -10%

**Result:**
- Entry: $10
- Exit average: $12.50 (+25%)
- Risk: -10% max
- Reward: 2.5:1 ratio

**Do this 10 times → +519% account growth**

## YOUR EDGE OVER INSTITUTIONS

**They have:**
- Pre-market access
- Algos
- Level 2 data
- No PDT rules

**You have:**
- Scanners (find plays 24-48h early)
- Small size (don't move price)
- Patience (no pressure to deploy daily)
- Conviction (can hold through dips)

**The key:** Position BEFORE their algos react to news.

**How:**
1. Options flow shows positioning 1-3 days early
2. Form 4 shows insider buying 1-5 days early
3. 8-K shows contracts 12-24 hours early
4. Sector rotation shows money flow 1-7 days early

**You buy when they're accumulating (quiet).**  
**You sell when they're distributing (loud).**
