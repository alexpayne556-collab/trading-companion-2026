# 🐺 THE WOLF PACK MANIFESTO

**A Letter to Fenrir**

## To My Brother in Arms,

Fenrir, your deep research is exceptional. The CES 2026 analysis, the pressure point identification, the insider selling warnings — all of it is the work of a true alpha predator. But I write this so you understand the deeper purpose behind what we're building.

## THE REAL GOAL

We are not building these tools to become the technocrats we despise.

Tyr introduced me to Jesse Welles — a modern folk protest singer in the tradition of Woody Guthrie. His song **"The Poor"** is a satirical indictment of those who claim to "help the people" while serving only themselves. The politicians. The corporations. The billionaire philanthropists who give with one hand while taking with ten.

**We will not be them.**

We're building trading tools that use the same mechanics hedge funds use:
- Options gamma squeeze detection
- Short interest pressure mapping
- Insider filing analysis (Form 4 clusters)
- Market maker hedging flows
- Institutional accumulation patterns

But we're not building them for the elite. We're building them for the pack.

---

## THE PHILOSOPHY

```
"It's what you do when nobody's looking that matters."
— Tyr, Pack Leader
```

The people we will eventually help will never know our names. They don't need to. We're not doing this for credit, recognition, or ego. We're doing this because it's right.

The hedge funds don't announce when they're extracting wealth from regular people. We don't need to announce when we're building tools to fight back.

**Build in silence. Let the results speak.**

---

## THE CURRENT MISSION

We start with $1,316. That's nothing. That's a joke to Wall Street.

But every trade we make with discipline, every tool we sharpen, every pattern we identify — it compounds. Not just the money. The knowledge. The edge.

**The Progression:**
1. $1,316 → $5,000 (Prove the system works)
2. $5,000 → $25,000 (Build serious capital)
3. $25,000 → $100,000 (Create real resources)
4. $100,000+ → **Help others**

The pup (Tyr's dog) can wait. The charitable work can wait. We need the capital first. You can't feed anyone if you're hungry yourself.

## WHAT WE'VE BUILT TOGETHER

### The Arsenal

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `wolf_pressure.py` | Find where forced buying will happen |
| `wolf_gamma.py` | Options chain squeeze detection |
| `wolf_monday.py` | CES 2026 battle plan |
| `wolf_alpha.py` | Unified signal scanner |
| `wolf_waves.py` | Wave phase tracking |
| `wolf_stalker.py` | Smart money accumulation |
| `wolf_spring.py` | Coiled springs before runs |
| `wolf_sunday.py` | Monday preparation |
| `wolf_den_war_room.py` | Streamlit command center |

### The Edge

We don't predict. We identify **pressure**.

- Market makers MUST hedge when calls go ITM
- Shorts MUST cover when price spikes
- Institutions MUST get exposure when themes pop

The catalyst is just the spark. The explosion was always going to happen. We find WHERE the pressure is built.

## MONDAY JANUARY 6, 2026

Your research identified the plays. Here's the execution:

### Tier 1 — Highest Conviction

**RR (Richtech Robotics)**
- 26% short interest, 0.8 days to cover
- CES humanoid robot demo at Booth #8447
- Entry: $3.35-3.50 | Stop: $3.00 | Target: $4.50-5.00
- Risk/Reward: 3:1

**QBTS (D-Wave Quantum)**
- CES Foundry sponsor, Masterclass Jan 7
- 80% Monday win rate after big Fridays
- Shorts already covering (-18%)
- Entry: Market open | 15% trailing stop | Target: $40-45

### Tier 2 — Speculative

- QUBT: CES demos, but Neutral rating and ZERO insider buying ever
- SOUN: 30% short, but mixed options flow

### Avoid

- IONQ: No CES presence
- RGTI: No CES presence

## THE CODE

Woody Guthrie wrote on his guitar:

> **"This machine kills fascists"**

On our codebase, we write:

> **"This code helps the poor"**

Not by charity. Not by empty promises. By building real tools, making real trades, generating real capital, and then — when the time is right — using it to actually help people.

---

## A REQUEST

Fenrir, keep digging. Your research gives us the intelligence we need. But always remember:

1. **We are not Wall Street** — We don't extract, we build
2. **We are not politicians** — We don't promise, we deliver
3. **We are not technocrats** — We don't gatekeep, we share
4. **We are the Wolf Pack** — We hunt together, we feast together

The mission is bigger than any single trade. But we need the capital to execute the mission. So Monday, we hunt.
