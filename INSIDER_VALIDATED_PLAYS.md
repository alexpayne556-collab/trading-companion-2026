# 🐺 WOLF PACK VALIDATED PLAYS
## January 2, 2026 - Insider Intelligence Report

## THE TRUTH WE DISCOVERED

Our scanners found wounded prey. But our INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM revealed:

| Ticker | Scanner Score | Insider Buying | VERDICT |
|--------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| SMR | 100 | ❌ NONE | UNVALIDATED |
| SOUN | 100 | ❌ NONE | UNVALIDATED |
| BBAI | 90 | ❌ NONE | UNVALIDATED |
| RGTI | 100 | ❌ NONE | UNVALIDATED |
| DNA | 90 | ❌ NONE | UNVALIDATED |
| LUNR | 85 | ❌ NONE | UNVALIDATED |

**Why this matters:**
- If insiders aren't buying at these "discounted" prices...
- They may know something we don't
- Pure technical plays without fundamental validation

## 📊 COMPARISON: VALIDATED vs UNVALIDATED

| Factor | AISP (Validated) | SMR (Unvalidated) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Insider Buying | ✅ $433K | ❌ NONE |
| Institutions | ✅ BlackRock +70% | ❓ Unknown |
| Analyst Target | ✅ $6 (Buy) | ❌ None |
| Contracts | ✅ 16 DoD/DHS | ❌ None recent |
| Price | $2.74 | $14.17 |
| Backtest | N/A (new find) | 68.8% (generic) |

**The insight:**
- SMR fits our GENERIC wounded prey thesis
- AISP fits a SPECIFIC insider-validated thesis
- Specific > Generic when we have the intelligence

## 🎯 THURSDAY BATTLE PLAN - UPDATED

### PRIORITY 1: Manage LUNR (Current Position)
- You're in at $16.85
- NO insider buying
- Political pump pattern
- **Action:** Exit $17.50+ or cut at $15

### PRIORITY 2: Consider VALIDATED Play
```
IF you want to enter a new position:

OPTION A: AISP @ $2.74 (RECOMMENDED)
- Insider validated ✅
- Institutional validated ✅  
- Analyst validated ✅
- Government contract validated ✅
- Position: $300-400

OPTION B: EFOI @ $2.29 (Higher Risk)
- CEO buying $1.7M+ ✅
- AI data center angle ✅
- But: Micro-cap, weak financials
- Position: $200 MAX

OPTION C: WAIT
- Paper trade these for a week
- Watch how they act
- Enter next week with more data
```

### PRIORITY 3: Skip Unvalidated Wounded Prey
```
DO NOT trade these Thursday:
- SMR (no insider buying)
- SOUN (no insider buying)
- BBAI (no insider buying)
- RGTI (no insider buying)

WHY: Our backtest showed wounded prey WORKS
BUT: This year's candidates lack validation
```

## 🧠 THE LESSON

**Before Intelligence System:**
"Scanner found SMR at 100/100, buy it!"

**After Intelligence System:**
"Scanner found SMR at 100/100, but insiders aren't buying...
Meanwhile AISP has $433K insider buying + BlackRock accumulation + DOJ contracts...
Trade AISP instead."

**This is the EDGE:**
- Not just finding opportunities
- VALIDATING them with insider intelligence
- Following the smart money, not the crowd

---

## 🛠️ NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Thursday (Jan 2)
1. Watch market open
2. Manage LUNR position
3. Consider AISP entry if market is green
4. Paper trade wounded prey to confirm thesis

### Phase 2: Friday-Sunday (Jan 3-5)
1. Build automated insider alert system
2. Run backtest on INSIDER-VALIDATED wounded prey
3. Enhance command center with insider layer
4. Track AISP/EFOI for entry opportunities

### Phase 3: Next Week (Jan 6+)
1. Deploy full intelligence system
2. Daily insider scanning
3. Cross-reference all opportunities
4. Build the edge systematically

"We don't gamble. We ENGINEER success."

**Today we learned:**
