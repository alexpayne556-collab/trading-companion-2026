### MESO LEVEL (Sector/Theme)
1. Is my target sector strong or weak vs SPY?
2. Are the leaders in my sector making new highs?
3. Is there a catalyst driving the sector?
4. How correlated are stocks within the sector?

### MICRO LEVEL (Individual Stock)

## MULTI-TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS

### The Fractal Nature of Charts

```
MONTHLY CHART: The war (long-term trend)
WEEKLY CHART:  The campaign (intermediate trend)
DAILY CHART:   The battle (short-term trend)
HOURLY CHART:  The skirmish (intraday trend)
15-MIN CHART:  The firefight (execution timing)
5-MIN CHART:   The trigger (precise entry)
1-MIN CHART:   The bullet (scalping only)
```

### Alignment Rule

**Trade in the direction of the higher timeframe.**

| Daily Trend | Hourly Trend | 15-Min Trend | Action |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| UP | UP | UP | STRONG BUY |
| UP | UP | DOWN | Wait for 15-min to turn up, then BUY |
| UP | DOWN | DOWN | WAIT - pullback in progress |
| DOWN | DOWN | DOWN | STRONG SELL/AVOID LONGS |
| DOWN | DOWN | UP | Wait for bounce to fail, then SHORT |

---

## VOLUME PROFILE ANALYSIS

### What Volume at Different Prices Tells You

```
HIGH VOLUME NODE (HVN):
• Price traded heavily here
• Acts as SUPPORT/RESISTANCE
• Price tends to consolidate here
• "Value area" - fair price agreed upon

LOW VOLUME NODE (LVN):
• Price moved quickly through
• Acts as MAGNET
• Price tends to accelerate through
• "Unfair price" - didn't stay long

POINT OF CONTROL (POC):
• Highest volume price
• Most "agreed upon" fair value
• Strong magnet for price
```

## THE MENTAL GAME

### Pre-Trade Checklist (Say out loud)

```
□ "I know WHY this stock is moving"
□ "The trend supports my direction"
□ "I have a clear entry and stop"
□ "My position size is correct"
□ "I accept I might be wrong"
□ "I will honor my stop loss"
```

### During Trade Mantras

```
WHEN WINNING:
"Profits are paper until booked"
"Raise stop to breakeven at 1R"
"Don't turn a winner into a loser"

WHEN LOSING:
"The stop is there for a reason"
"One loss doesn't define me"
"Honor the plan"

WHEN UNCERTAIN:
"When in doubt, stay out"
"Cash is a position"
"There's always another trade"
```

### Post-Trade Review Questions

```
1. Did I follow my rules?
2. Was my thesis correct?
3. Was my timing good?
4. Was my size appropriate?
5. Did I manage the trade well?
6. What would I do differently?
7. Is this a setup I should take again?
```

## EDGE IDENTIFICATION

### Where Your Edge Comes From

| Edge Type | Description | How to Develop |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| INFORMATION | Know something others don't | Deep research, catalyst tracking |
| ANALYTICAL | See patterns others miss | Screen time, pattern recognition |
| BEHAVIORAL | Stay calm when others panic | Meditation, journaling, rules |
| STRUCTURAL | Exploit market mechanics | Study microstructure, order flow |
| TIMING | Enter/exit at right moments | Tape reading, multi-timeframe |

### You DON'T Have Edge If:

- You're chasing a move after it happened
- You don't know why it's moving
- You're trading on emotion
- Your thesis is "it's going up"
- You can't define your risk
- Everyone else is in the trade
