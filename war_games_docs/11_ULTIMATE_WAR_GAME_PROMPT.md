## NOTES ON USING THIS PROMPT:

This prompt is MASSIVE. Perplexity may need to break it into parts. If it asks, tell it:

"Start with PART 1: Complete Sector Universe. Give me all tickers for all 15 sectors first."

Then follow up with:

"Now run PART 2: Complete Scenario Matrix with probabilities."

Then:

"Now give me the DELIVERABLES 1-10."

You may need 3-4 conversations to get everything.

---

## AFTER PERPLEXITY RUNS THIS:

We will have:
1. Complete ticker universe across 15 sectors (probably 500+ tickers)
2. Every scenario that could happen with probabilities
3. How each scenario affects each sector
4. Warning signs for each scenario
5. Action plans for each outcome
6. Your complete Q1 2026 playbook

Then we build your Fidelity layouts around this intelligence.
