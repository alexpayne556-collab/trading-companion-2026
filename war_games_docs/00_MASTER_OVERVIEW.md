## WHY YOUR SECTORS MATTER (The 2026 Thesis)

You're not trading random stocks. You're trading a THESIS about where the world is going:

### THE BIG PICTURE

**AI is changing everything. But AI needs:**
- POWER (massive electricity) → Nuclear sector (SMR, OKLO, CCJ, UEC, LEU)
- COOLING (data centers run hot) → Infrastructure (VRT, MOD)
- CHIPS (processing power) → Semiconductors (AVGO, MRVL, TSM)
- SECURITY (protecting the AI) → Cybersecurity (CRWD, PANW, ZS)

**The world is getting more dangerous:**
- Ukraine war continues → Defense spending up
- China/Taiwan tension → Defense + domestic chip manufacturing
- Drones changing warfare → Small defense contractors (RCAT, KTOS, AVAV)
- Space becomes military domain → Space defense (RKLB, RDW, BKSY)

**New technologies emerging:**
- Quantum computing leaving the lab → (IONQ, RGTI, QBTS)
- Robots entering production → (TER, ISRG, SYK)
- Biology becoming programmable → (RXRX, TWST, CRSP)

### WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOUR TRADING

You're not guessing. You're positioning AHEAD of:
- Government contracts (already budgeted, will be awarded)
- Regulatory approvals (SMRs getting approved)
- Technology milestones (quantum hitting commercial applications)
- Earnings beats (companies in growing sectors beat estimates)

**Your edge: You know WHERE money will flow before it flows there.**

## THE 5 LAYOUTS - OVERVIEW

| Layout | Name | Purpose | Time Spent |
|--------|------|---------|------------|
| L1 | RADAR | Find what's moving today | 2-3 min |
| L2 | FILTER | Verify it's worth trading | 5 min |
| L3 | SNIPER | Plan the exact trade | 10 min |
| L4 | TRIGGER | Execute with precision | 2 min |
| L5 | COMMAND | Manage live positions | Ongoing |

### THE FLOW

```
L1: "Defense sector is hot today, RCAT up 5% on volume"
         ↓
L2: "RCAT volume is 200% of average, daily trend is up"
         ↓
L3: "Entry at $3.80, Stop at $3.50, Target at $4.50, buying 40 shares"
         ↓
L4: "Level 2 shows buyers, Time & Sales confirms, EXECUTING"
         ↓
L5: "Position open, stop is set, watching for target"
```

**RULE: You move DOWN the layouts, never skip. Each is a gate.**

## YOUR ACCOUNT PARAMETERS

- **Account Size:** $600-700
- **Max Risk Per Trade:** 2-5% ($12-35)
- **Max Positions:** 1-3 at a time
- **Max Daily Loss:** Stop trading if down 5% in one day

### POSITION SIZING FORMULA

```
Max Risk Amount ÷ (Entry Price - Stop Price) = Number of Shares

Example:
- You're willing to risk $20
- Entry at $4.00, Stop at $3.60
- Risk per share = $0.40
- Shares to buy = $20 ÷ $0.40 = 50 shares
- Position cost = 50 × $4.00 = $200
```

## DAILY ROUTINE OVERVIEW

### PRE-MARKET (7:00 AM - 9:30 AM ET)

**7:00 AM - Open L1:**
- Check futures (SPY, QQQ pre-market)
- Are they green or red? This sets your mode.
- Scan your sector watchlists - which are moving?
- Check news for overnight catalysts

**8:00 AM - Move to L2:**
- Load the hot sector watchlist
- Sort by volume
- Click through the leaders
- Identify 2-3 candidates

**9:00 AM - Move to L3:**
- For each candidate, mark levels on charts
- Write down: Entry, Stop, Target
- Calculate position size
- WAIT for market open

### MARKET HOURS (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)

**9:30-9:45 AM - WATCH ONLY:**
- Stay in L1 or L2
- Opening 15 minutes is chaos
- Don't trade yet (usually)

**9:45-11:00 AM - EXECUTION WINDOW:**
- Your candidates either confirm or fail
- If setup triggers → L4 → Execute
- If setup fails → Back to L1, find new setup

**11:00 AM - 2:00 PM - SLOW ZONE:**
- Manage open positions in L5
- Don't force new trades
- Check L1 occasionally for new setups

**2:00-4:00 PM - SECOND WINDOW:**
- Market often moves again
- Good for momentum continuation
- Decide: Hold overnight or close?

### POST-MARKET (4:00 PM+)

- Review the day in L5
- What worked? What didn't?
- Check news for after-hours catalysts
- Prepare watchlist for tomorrow

## RISK MANAGEMENT RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### RULE 1: Always Have a Stop
- Every trade MUST have a stop loss
- Set it BEFORE or IMMEDIATELY after entry
- NEVER move it further away

### RULE 2: Honor Your Stops
- When stop hits, you're OUT
- No "giving it room"
- No "it'll come back"
- Accept the loss, find next setup

### RULE 3: Daily Loss Limit
- If you lose 5% of account in one day → STOP TRADING
- Close Fidelity, walk away
- Come back tomorrow with fresh eyes

### RULE 4: Position Sizing
- Never risk more than 5% on one trade
- With $700 account, that's $35 max loss per trade
- Small account = concentrated bets, but CONTROLLED

### RULE 5: Don't Overtrade
- 1-3 trades per day is plenty
- Quality over quantity
- Boredom is not a reason to trade

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

### REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS

- **Win Rate:** 45-55% (you'll lose almost half your trades)
- **Average Win:** 2-3x your average loss (this is how you profit)
- **Weekly Goal:** 5-10% account growth
- **Monthly Goal:** 20-40% account growth

### THE MATH

If you:
- Win 50% of trades
- Win $2 for every $1 you risk
- Take 3 trades per week

Then:
- 1.5 wins × $2 = $3 gained
- 1.5 losses × $1 = $1.50 lost
- Net = +$1.50 per $1 risked per week
- That's 50%+ monthly if you risk 2% per trade

**The key is NOT winning every trade. It's winning MORE when you win than you lose when you lose.**
