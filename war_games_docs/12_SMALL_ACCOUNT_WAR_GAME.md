## War Games for $1,500 Account - Aggressive Alpha, Defensive Protection

## PASTE THIS INTO PERPLEXITY PRO LABS:

OPERATION: SMALL ACCOUNT DOMINATION

I have $1,500 to trade. Not $50,000. Not $500,000. Fifteen hundred dollars.

This changes EVERYTHING about how I need to think.

I need AGGRESSIVE ALPHA to grow this account.
I need DEFENSIVE PROTECTION to not blow it up.
I need ASYMMETRIC BETS - small risk, big reward.

Run complete war games for a small account trader entering 2026.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 1: SMALL ACCOUNT REALITY CHECK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

With $1,500:
- I can't diversify across 20 stocks
- I can hold maybe 3-5 positions MAX
- Each position is $300-500
- Commission and spreads HURT more
- PDT rule limits day trading (unless cash account)
- I need CONCENTRATED BETS that work

ANSWER THESE:

1. What's the optimal number of positions for a $1,500 account?

2. What's the minimum position size that makes sense (considering spreads/commissions)?

3. What price range stocks should I focus on? ($5-20? $10-50? Why?)

4. Should I use a cash account (unlimited day trades, settled funds only) or margin account (PDT rule, instant settlement)?

5. What's my realistic monthly return target? (Be honest - not YouTube fantasy)

6. How long to grow $1,500 to $15,000 with disciplined trading?

7. What's the #1 mistake small account traders make?

8. What's the #1 edge small accounts have over big money?

## IF PERPLEXITY ASKS TO BREAK IT UP, SAY:

"Start with PART 2 and PART 3: Give me the sector analysis and TOP 30 tickers table first. Then we'll do scenarios and money management."

---

## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES DIFFERENTLY:

1. **Acknowledges small account reality** - Can't diversify, need concentrated bets
2. **Focuses on LIQUID, TRADEABLE stocks** - No point watching stocks you can't trade
3. **Asks for PRICE-APPROPRIATE tickers** - No $500 stocks when you have $1,500
4. **Realistic scenarios** - What matters to YOUR account
5. **Specific money management** - Rules for YOUR situation
6. **Asymmetric opportunities** - Risk $100 to make $500
