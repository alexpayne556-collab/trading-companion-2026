# INDICATOR GUIDE
## What Every Number and Chart Element Actually Means

---

## PART 1: WATCHLIST COLUMNS (The Numbers Next to Ticker Symbols)

When you look at a watchlist, you see columns of numbers. Here's what each means:

### SYMBOL
The ticker symbol (like RCAT, IONQ, SMR)
- This is just the stock's abbreviation
- You already know this

### LAST (or Price)
The most recent price the stock traded at
- Example: RCAT Last = $3.82
- This updates in real-time during market hours

### $ CHG (Dollar Change)
How much the price changed TODAY in dollars
- Green/positive = up from yesterday's close
- Red/negative = down from yesterday's close
- Example: +$0.15 means it's 15 cents higher than yesterday

### % CHG (Percent Change)
How much the price changed TODAY in percentage
- More useful than dollar change for comparing stocks
- Example: +4.5% means it's up 4.5% from yesterday's close
- **WHY IT MATTERS:** Stocks up 3%+ on volume are "in play"

### VOLUME
How many shares traded TODAY
- Higher = more activity/interest
- Example: 500,000 means 500,000 shares changed hands today
- **BY ITSELF, this number is hard to interpret**

### VOL % AVG (Volume Percent of Average) ← CRITICAL
Today's volume COMPARED to the stock's average daily volume
- 100% = normal volume
- 150% = 1.5x normal (something's happening)
- 200% = 2x normal (significant activity)
- 300%+ = unusual, often means news/catalyst
- **WHY IT MATTERS:** Volume precedes price. High volume = big money moving.

### BID
The highest price a BUYER is currently willing to pay
- Example: Bid = $3.80
- This is what you'd get if you sold RIGHT NOW with a market order

### ASK
The lowest price a SELLER is currently willing to accept
- Example: Ask = $3.82
- This is what you'd pay if you bought RIGHT NOW with a market order

### SPREAD (Ask - Bid)
The difference between Ask and Bid
- Tight spread ($0.01-0.02) = liquid, easy to trade
- Wide spread ($0.10+) = less liquid, harder to trade
- **WHY IT MATTERS:** Wide spreads cost you money on entry AND exit

### 52W HIGH / 52W LOW
The highest and lowest prices in the past year (52 weeks)
- Near 52W High = stock is strong, but maybe extended
- Near 52W Low = stock is weak, or potential bounce
- **WHY IT MATTERS:** Breakouts above 52W High are powerful

### 52W HI % (Distance from 52-Week High)
How far below the 52-week high the stock is
- 0% = AT the 52-week high
- -10% = 10% below the high
- -50% = half of its high (beaten down)
- **WHY IT MATTERS:** Stocks within 5% of highs often break out

### GAP %
How much the stock moved BEFORE today's market open
- Gap Up (+5%) = opened 5% higher than yesterday's close
- Gap Down (-3%) = opened 3% lower
- **WHY IT MATTERS:** Gaps often indicate overnight news/catalyst

## PART 2: CHART INDICATORS (The Lines on the Chart)

### PRICE CANDLES (The Red and Green Bars)

Each candle shows price movement for ONE time period:
- 1-minute chart = each candle is 1 minute
- Daily chart = each candle is 1 day

**GREEN CANDLE:**
- Price went UP during that period
- Bottom of body = open price
- Top of body = close price
- Wicks (thin lines) = high and low reached

**RED CANDLE:**
- Price went DOWN during that period
- Top of body = open price
- Bottom of body = close price
- Wicks = high and low reached

**WHAT TO LOOK FOR:**
- Big green candles with high volume = strong buying
- Big red candles with high volume = strong selling
- Small candles = indecision, potential breakout coming

---

### MOVING AVERAGES (The Smooth Lines)

Moving averages smooth out price to show the TREND.

**EMA (Exponential Moving Average):**
- Reacts faster to recent price changes
- Better for short-term trading
- You'll use: 9 EMA, 21 EMA

**SMA (Simple Moving Average):**
- Slower, smoother, more stable
- Better for longer-term trend
- You'll use: 50 SMA, 200 SMA

### YOUR MOVING AVERAGE SETUP:

**9 EMA (Yellow Line) - FAST MOMENTUM**
- Shows very short-term momentum (days)
- Price above 9 EMA = bullish short-term
- Price below 9 EMA = bearish short-term
- **USE IT FOR:** Timing entries and exits

**21 EMA (Blue Line) - SWING TREND**
- Shows short-term trend (weeks)
- Price above 21 EMA = uptrend
- Price below 21 EMA = downtrend
- **USE IT FOR:** Confirming trend direction

**50 SMA (White Line) - INTERMEDIATE TREND**
- Shows medium-term trend (months)
- Price above 50 SMA = healthy uptrend
- Price below 50 SMA = weakening or downtrend
- **USE IT FOR:** Pullback buy zones (price often bounces off 50 SMA)

**200 SMA (Red Line) - MAJOR TREND**
- Shows long-term trend (institutional reference)
- Price above 200 SMA = BULL MARKET for this stock
- Price below 200 SMA = BEAR MARKET for this stock
- **USE IT FOR:** Determining if stock is in overall uptrend or downtrend

### MOVING AVERAGE SIGNALS:

**BULLISH SIGNALS:**
- Price crosses ABOVE a moving average
- Faster MA crosses ABOVE slower MA (9 crosses above 21)
- All MAs stacked in order (9 > 21 > 50 > 200)

**BEARISH SIGNALS:**
- Price crosses BELOW a moving average
- Faster MA crosses BELOW slower MA
- MAs stacked in reverse (9 < 21 < 50 < 200)

### VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) - THE MOST IMPORTANT INTRADAY INDICATOR

**WHAT IT IS:**
- The average price paid for shares TODAY, weighted by volume
- Resets every day at market open
- Shows the "fair price" for the day

**HOW TO READ IT:**
- Price ABOVE VWAP = buyers are winning today
- Price BELOW VWAP = sellers are winning today
- Price AT VWAP = balanced, could go either way

**WHY IT MATTERS:**
- Institutions use VWAP to measure execution quality
- They often buy below VWAP, sell above VWAP
- VWAP acts as support/resistance during the day

**TRADING RULES:**
- Don't buy below VWAP unless it's a specific pullback setup
- Strongest longs are above VWAP
- If price rejects at VWAP multiple times = bearish

---

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)

**WHAT IT IS:**
- Momentum indicator that measures speed of price changes
- Ranges from 0 to 100
- Shown in a separate pane below the main chart

**HOW TO READ IT:**
- RSI > 70 = OVERBOUGHT (stock may be extended, don't chase)
- RSI < 30 = OVERSOLD (stock may be due for bounce)
- RSI 40-60 = NEUTRAL (normal trading range)

**COMMON SETTINGS:**
- Period: 14 (standard, use this)

**WHY IT MATTERS:**
- Warns you when a stock is TOO extended to chase
- Shows potential bounce zones on oversold conditions
- Divergences (price makes new high but RSI doesn't) = warning

**TRADING RULES:**
- Don't buy when RSI > 75 (wait for pullback)
- Look for bounces when RSI < 30 + support level
- RSI crossing above 50 = momentum turning bullish

---

### VOLUME BARS (The Bars at the Bottom of Chart)

**WHAT THEY SHOW:**
- How many shares traded during each candle's time period
- Green bar = price closed higher than it opened
- Red bar = price closed lower than it opened

**WHAT TO LOOK FOR:**
- High volume on UP moves = strong buying (good)
- High volume on DOWN moves = strong selling (bad)
- Low volume on pullbacks = weak selling (healthy pullback)
- High volume breakout = likely to continue

**VOLUME AVERAGE LINE:**
- Add a 20-period moving average to volume
- Bars ABOVE the line = above average volume
- This quickly shows you if today's volume is unusual

---

## PART 3: LEVEL 2 (Order Book)

Level 2 shows you the actual BUY and SELL orders waiting to be filled.

### THE BID SIDE (Left/Green)
- Shows all the buy orders waiting
- Highest bid at top
- Shows price AND size (number of shares)
- More bids = more support below

### THE ASK SIDE (Right/Red)
- Shows all the sell orders waiting
- Lowest ask at top
- Shows price AND size
- Fewer asks = less resistance above

### HOW TO READ IT:

**BULLISH LEVEL 2:**
- Bids are large and stacking (support building)
- Asks are small and thin (easy to push through)
- Bid side "thicker" than ask side

**BEARISH LEVEL 2:**
- Asks are large (resistance/sellers waiting)
- Bids are small and thin
- Price likely to drop

**THINGS TO WATCH:**
- Large orders at specific prices = key levels
- Orders appearing/disappearing = traders adjusting
- Spread tightening = about to move

---

## PART 4: TIME & SALES (The Tape)

Time & Sales shows every ACTUAL trade that executes.

### WHAT YOU SEE:
- Time: When the trade happened
- Price: What price it traded at
- Size: How many shares
- Color: Green (bought at ask) or Red (sold at bid)

### HOW TO READ IT:

**GREEN PRINTS AT ASK:**
- Buyer willing to pay the ask price
- Shows urgency/demand
- Many green prints = buying pressure

**RED PRINTS AT BID:**
- Seller willing to accept the bid price
- Shows urgency to sell
- Many red prints = selling pressure

**LARGE PRINTS:**
- 1,000+ shares on small caps = institutional
- 10,000+ shares = significant institutional
- Watch for clusters of large prints

### TRADING SIGNALS:

**BUY SIGNAL:**
- Many green prints, especially large ones
- Prints happening fast (active buying)
- Price ticking up with each print

**SELL/AVOID SIGNAL:**
- Many red prints, especially large ones
- Large asks not getting hit (resistance)
- Price ticking down despite volume

---

## PART 5: SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE

### SUPPORT
A price level where BUYERS tend to step in
- Previous lows
- Moving averages (50 SMA, 200 SMA)
- VWAP
- Round numbers ($5, $10, $50)

**HOW TO USE:**
- Buy near support levels
- Put stop loss BELOW support
- If support breaks = bearish

### RESISTANCE
A price level where SELLERS tend to step in
- Previous highs
- Moving averages (when price is below them)
- 52-week high
- Round numbers

**HOW TO USE:**
- Take profits near resistance
- Or wait for breakout ABOVE resistance
- Resistance that breaks becomes support
