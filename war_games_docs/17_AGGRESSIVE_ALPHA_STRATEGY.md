# AGGRESSIVE ALPHA STRATEGY
## No Fear. Maximum Conviction. Built to 10X.

---

**MINDSET SHIFT:**

```
❌ SURVIVAL MODE: "Don't lose money"
✅ THRIVE MODE: "Capture the big moves"

❌ SCARED: "What if it drops?"
✅ AGGRESSIVE: "What if it doubles?"

❌ DIVERSIFIED: 10 positions, 10% each
✅ CONCENTRATED: 3-4 positions, MAXIMUM CONVICTION
```

# THE MATH OF WINNING BIG

## Why Concentration Beats Diversification for Small Accounts

```
SCARED PORTFOLIO ($1,500 split 6 ways):
- 6 positions × $250 each
- One doubles (+$250), others flat
- Total return: +17%
- You made: $250
- TIME WASTED: Could have made more

AGGRESSIVE PORTFOLIO ($1,500 concentrated):
- 2-3 positions × $500-750 each  
- One doubles (+$500-750)
- Total return: +33-50%
- You made: $500-750
- THAT'S HOW YOU COMPOUND
```

**THE TRUTH:** With $1,500, you need CONCENTRATED BETS on HIGH CONVICTION plays.

# THE 10X FRAMEWORK

## What Makes a Stock 10X?

```
1. SMALL MARKET CAP ($500M - $2B)
   - Room to grow
   - Institutions can't buy yet
   - When they can = you're already in

2. MASSIVE CATALYST COMING
   - Contract award
   - Product launch
   - Regulatory approval
   - Earnings surprise

3. SECTOR TAILWIND
   - Not fighting the trend
   - Riding a wave
   - Multiple catalysts possible

4. HASN'T RUN YET
   - Not already up 300%
   - Still under the radar
   - Early innings
```

# THE COMPOUND PLAN

## How $1,500 Becomes $150,000

```
PHASE 1: $1,500 → $4,500 (3X) - 6-12 months
- Concentrated bets on RCAT, DNN, RGTI
- One or two hit big
- Take profits, reinvest

PHASE 2: $4,500 → $15,000 (3.3X) - 12-18 months
- Larger positions, same strategy
- Compound winners
- Find next RCAT/DNN type plays

PHASE 3: $15,000 → $50,000 (3.3X) - 18-24 months
- Real money now
- Can diversify slightly more
- Still concentrated on conviction

PHASE 4: $50,000 → $150,000 (3X) - 24-36 months
- Professional-level account
- Multiple positions
- Consistent 50-100% annual returns

TOTAL TIME: 3-4 years
TOTAL RETURN: 100X
```

**THIS IS HOW TRADERS BUILD WEALTH.**

# AGGRESSIVE RULES (Different from Defensive)

## ENTRIES

```
✓ Buy when thesis is RIGHT, not when price is "safe"
✓ Average UP into winners, not down into losers
✓ Add when stock proves you right
✓ Size up on highest conviction
```

## STOPS (Still Required - But Strategic)

```
✓ Stop at -25% (wider than conservative)
✓ Give positions room to work
✓ Don't get shaken out by noise
✓ BUT: If thesis breaks, EXIT IMMEDIATELY

RCAT stop: $6.00 (25% below $8)
DNN stop: $1.50 (25% below $2)
SEALSQ stop: $3.00 (25% below $4)
RGTI stop: $6.00 (25% below $8)
```

## PROFIT TAKING (Let Winners Run)

```
✓ Don't sell winners early
✓ First trim at +50% (sell 25%)
✓ Second trim at +100% (sell 25%)
✓ Let 50% ride for the moon
✓ Trail stop at -30% from high

EXAMPLE:
- Buy RCAT at $8
- At $12 (+50%): Sell 16 shares, keep 49
- At $16 (+100%): Sell 12 shares, keep 37
- Let 37 shares ride to $30+
- Trail stop at 30% below high
```

## CONCENTRATION (Feature, Not Bug)

```
✓ 3-4 positions MAX
✓ 25-40% per position
✓ Know each position DEEPLY
✓ Follow every piece of news
✓ Be the expert on YOUR stocks
```

# THE MENTAL GAME

## What Winners Think:

```
"This position is down 15%"
→ LOSER: "I should sell before it gets worse"
→ WINNER: "Is my thesis still valid? Yes? Then hold."

"This position is up 50%"
→ LOSER: "I should take profits before it falls"
→ WINNER: "This is working. Let it run. Trim small."

"The market is crashing"
→ LOSER: "Sell everything!"
→ WINNER: "Is my thesis broken? No? Buy the dip."

"Everyone says this stock is risky"
→ LOSER: "Maybe I should sell"
→ WINNER: "I did the work. I know more than them."
```

## The Truth About Big Winners:

```
RCAT could go from $8 to $50 (6X)
- But it will NOT go straight up
- It will drop 20-30% multiple times
- It will have scary days
- It will test your conviction

THE TRADERS WHO WIN:
- Buy because of THESIS
- Hold because of THESIS
- Sell only when THESIS BREAKS
- Ignore the noise
```
