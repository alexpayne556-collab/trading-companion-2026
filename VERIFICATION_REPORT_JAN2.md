## THE BRUTAL TRUTH

**INSIDERS ARE ALWAYS EARLY.**

When you see massive insider buying:
1. They bought MONTHS ago at the bottom
2. By the time you see it, stock already ran
3. You're late unless you catch it FAST

**EXAMPLES:**
- BFLY: Larry Robbins bought $2.35-3.06, now $3.80 (+28%)
- HYMC: Eric Sprott bought $8-25, now $24 (but bought at $8 = 3x)
- VSTS: Keith Meister bought $6.34-6.81, now $6.67 (flat)

**AISP IS DIFFERENT:**
- Paul Allen bought Dec 29 @ $2.74
- TODAY: $2.89 (+5%)
- **WE'RE STILL EARLY** ✅

3. **BLND** - $22M conviction, +21.6% (borderline wounded) 🟡
4. **RPD** - 30/100, wounded (+15.1%), $653K JANA 🟡
