# TRADING MINDSET: LOSERS VS WINNERS
# Reason to Trade and Why Mindset Matters
# Source: User's trading psychology notes, December 2025

## LOSERS THINK:
- "I hope this goes up"
- "I'll sell when I feel like it"
- "That stock is cheap"
- "I'm down, I'll hold"
- "I need to make money today"

## WINNERS THINK:
- "I have a plan if it goes up OR down"
- "I'll sell at my target or stop, no emotion"
- "That stock is at support with a catalyst"
- "My stop hit, I'm out, next trade"
- "I need to follow my process today"

## WHY THIS MATTERS
- Trading is about process, not hope
- Winners have a plan for every scenario
- Discipline and process protect your capital
- Emotional trading leads to big losses
- Every trade must have a reason: support, catalyst, plan, and exit

# More mindset and process rules to be added as needed.
