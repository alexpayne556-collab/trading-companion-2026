    "\n",
    "1. You submit order through broker (Robinhood, Schwab, etc.)\n",
    "2. Broker has choices:\n",
    "   - Route to exchange (NYSE, NASDAQ)\n",
    "   - Route to market maker (Citadel, Virtu)\n",
    "   - Internalize (fill from own inventory)\n",
    "3. Most retail orders go to market makers via PFOF (Payment for Order Flow)\n",
    "4. Market maker sees your order BEFORE filling it\n",
