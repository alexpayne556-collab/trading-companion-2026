## The AR Thesis

2. **Analyst Support:** Multiple upgrades, price targets $44-48
3. **Momentum Catalyst:** Nat gas breaking out = AR follows
4. **Institutional Interest:** Volume and option flow confirm accumulation

### Technical Setup
- **Breakout:** Above resistance at $35
- **Volume:** Increasing on up-moves
- **Structure:** Higher lows, respecting support
- **Momentum:** Bullish continuation pattern

---

## Execution Plan

### Entry Strategy
- **Target Zone:** $36-37 range (current area)
- **Size:** Position calculated using 2% risk rule
- **Stop Loss:** Below $34 (support level)
- **Time Frame:** Swing trade, 2-4 week horizon

### Exit Strategy  
**Profit Targets:**
1. **T1 (40%):** $40 - Take 25% off, move stop to breakeven
2. **T2 (60%):** $44 - Take another 35% off
3. **T3 (Trail):** $48+ - Let remaining 40% run with trailing stop

**Stop Management:**
- Initial: Hard stop at $34 (entered at $36.50 = 6.8% risk)
- After T1: Move to breakeven ($36.50)
- After T2: Trail with 8% chandelier or 21 EMA

## Risk Management Rules

### Position Sizing
- Max 8% of portfolio in AR
- If adding on strength, max total 12%
- Each add must respect 2% portfolio risk rule

### Portfolio Context
- This is a **growth allocation** play
- Fits natural gas sector exposure
- Complements tech/defense positions
- Diversification: Commodities exposure

### Contingencies
**If AR fails (breaks $34):**
- Cut immediately, no questions
- Do NOT average down
- Reassess nat gas thesis
- Wait for reclaim of $35 before re-entry

**If AR rips to $40+ quickly:**
- Take partial profits (T1)
- Lock in gains, let winners run
- Trail aggressively with 8% chandelier

## The Key Edge: Form 4s and Form 144s

**THIS IS YOUR REAL-TIME ALPHA**

### Form 4 (Insider Trading)
- **What:** Officers/Directors buying/selling stock
- **Why It Matters:** Insiders know the company best
- **Red Flag:** Multiple insiders selling (exit signal)
- **Green Flag:** CEO/CFO buying = strong confidence
- **Action:** If AR insiders start selling heavily → tighten stops

### Form 144 (Intent to Sell Restricted Stock)
- **What:** Pre-announcement of insider stock sale
- **Why It Matters:** Early warning system (30-90 days ahead)
- **Red Flag:** Large Form 144 filings = supply coming
- **Green Flag:** Low/no Form 144s = tight supply
- **Action:** Track AR's SEC filings daily for Form 144 volume

**Monitoring Protocol:**
1. Check SEC EDGAR daily for AR (CIK: 0001433270)
2. Set alerts for Form 4 and Form 144 filings
3. Cross-reference with price action
4. If insiders sell + stock drops = EXIT

---

## Market Environment Considerations

### Broader Market
- **SPY/QQQ:** Monitor for weakness that could drag AR
- **VIX:** Rising volatility = tighter stops
- **Sector Rotation:** Energy in favor = tailwind

### Natural Gas Watch
- **Weather Reports:** Cold = bullish for nat gas
- **Storage Data:** EIA reports weekly (Thursdays 10:30 AM ET)
- **UNG ETF:** Confirm nat gas momentum
