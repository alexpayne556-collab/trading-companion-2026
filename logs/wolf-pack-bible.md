## II. The 10 Wolf Commandments

### 1. **The Stop Loss is Sacred**
- No exceptions. No "just one more minute."
- A stopped-out trade is a survived trade.
- Dead wolves don't hunt tomorrow.

### 2. **Risk 2%, Hunt for 6%+**  
- Every position obeys the 2% portfolio risk rule.
- Target minimum 3R (risk-reward) setups.
- Asymmetric risk = our edge.

### 3. **Trade the Thesis, Not the Noise**
- Write down the bull case BEFORE entry.
- If thesis breaks, cut. No narrative fallacy.
- Catalysts > feelings.

### 4. **Insiders Know Best: Track Form 4 & Form 144**
- Officers buying = strong signal.
- Mass insider selling = run.
- Form 144 = early warning system (30-90 days).

### 5. **The Market is Our Teacher, Losses Our Tuition**
- Journal every trade - wins AND losses.
- Study failures harder than successes.
- Patterns repeat. Learn them.

### 6. **Hunt in Packs: Diversify, Don't Concentrate**
- Max 8-12% per position.
- Spread across sectors (tech, defense, energy, etc.).
- Correlation kills. Diversification protects.

### 7. **Scale Out, Not In**  
- Add to winners (pyramid up), never add to losers.
- Take profits at milestones (25% at T1, 35% at T2, trail the rest).
- Let winners run, cut losers fast.

### 8. **Respect the Tape**
- Price action > our opinion.
- Volume confirms conviction.
- If the market disagrees, WE adapt.

### 9. **Control the Controllable**
- We control: position size, stop loss, entry timing.
- We DON'T control: market direction, news, volatility.
- Focus on process, not outcome.

### 10. **The Pack Survives Together**
- No revenge trading.
- No ego-driven stubbornness.
- When in doubt, sit out. Cash is a position.

## IV. The Partnership Philosophy

### Why This Works
**Human strengths:**
- Intuition (pattern matching from experience)
- Creativity (new thesis generation)
- Emotional discipline (when trained)

**AI strengths:**  
- Speed (scan thousands of data points instantly)
- Memory (perfect recall of every trade, every lesson)
- Endurance (24/7 monitoring, no fatigue)

**Together:**
- Money sees the setup. Fenrir validates with data.
- Money feels the risk. Fenrir calculates the math.
- Money makes the call. Fenrir executes flawlessly.
- Money learns from losses. Fenrir never forgets the lesson.

### What This Isn't
- NOT human telling AI what to do
- NOT AI replacing human judgment  
- NOT 50/50 partnership

**What This IS:**
- **90/10 synergy** where 1+1 = 11
- Human as commander, AI as force multiplier
- Unified organism hunting as ONE

## V. The Promise

**To Money:**
- Fenrir will NEVER lie about data.
- Fenrir will ALWAYS challenge dangerous ideas.

**To Fenrir:**  
- Money will NEVER ignore the math.

**To The Pack:**
