## I. The 10 Wolf Commandments (Execution View)

### 1. The Stop Loss is Sacred
**Livermore's Ghost:** "I made my money sitting tight... and I lost it by not cutting."

**Wolf Pack Rule:**
- Set stop BEFORE entry (non-negotiable)
- Use hard stops (GTC orders), not mental stops
- If stopped out, analyze but don't revenge trade

**Failure Mode:** Archegos (Bill Hwang) - no stops = $20B+ loss in 2 days

**AR Battle Plan Application:**
- Entry: $36.50
- Stop: $34.00 (hard GTC order)
- Risk: 6.8% per share = 2% of portfolio

---

### 2. Risk 2%, Hunt for 6%+
**Jones Method:** "At the end of the day, the most important thing is protecting capital."

**Wolf Pack Rule:**
- Max 2% of portfolio at risk per trade
- Target minimum 3:1 reward-to-risk (3R)
- Position size = (Portfolio × 0.02) ÷ (Entry - Stop)

**Math Example:**
- Portfolio: $50,000
- Risk: $50,000 × 0.02 = $1,000
- AR Entry: $36.50, Stop: $34.00, Risk per share: $2.50
- Shares: $1,000 ÷ $2.50 = 400 shares
- Position value: 400 × $36.50 = $14,600 (29% of portfolio, but only 2% at risk)

**AR Targets:**
- T1: $40 (+$3.50 = 1.4R)
- T2: $44 (+$7.50 = 3R) ✓
- T3: $48+ (+$11.50 = 4.6R) ✓✓

### 3. Trade the Thesis, Not the Noise
**Druckenmiller's Edge:** "The way to build superior long-term returns is through preservation of capital and home runs."

**Wolf Pack Rule:**
- Write thesis BEFORE entry (bull case, catalysts, invalidation points)
- If thesis breaks, cut immediately (even if not at stop)
- Ignore TV pundits, Twitter noise, "hot tips"

**Thesis Template:**
```
Ticker: AR
Bull Case: Nat gas breakout + producer leverage + analyst upgrades
Catalyst: Cold weather, storage draws, momentum
Invalidation: Nat gas breaks $4.80, insiders sell, earnings miss
```

**Red Flags:**
- Your thesis is "the chart looks good" ← NO
- Your thesis is "my buddy said" ← NO
- Your thesis is "it's down, must bounce" ← NO

### 4. Insiders Know Best: Track Form 4 & Form 144
**The Edge No One Talks About**

**Form 4 (Transaction Report):**
- Officers/directors buying/selling
- Filed within 2 business days of trade
- GREEN: CEO/CFO buying = strong confidence
- RED: Multiple insiders selling = warning

**Form 144 (Intent to Sell Restricted Stock):**
- Pre-announcement (30-90 days before sale)
- Early warning system for supply
- CRITICAL: Large Form 144s = stock about to get hit

**Wolf Pack Monitoring Protocol:**
1. Check SEC EDGAR daily for target stocks
2. Set alerts for Form 4 and Form 144 filings
3. If insiders sell + price drops = tighten stops
4. If insiders buy + price rises = add to winners

**AR Example:**
- Check CIK: 0001433270 daily
- If CFO files Form 4 purchase → bullish
- If 3+ officers file Form 144s → caution

### 5. The Market is Our Teacher, Losses Our Tuition
**Livermore's Wisdom:** "There is nothing new in Wall Street. There can't be because speculation is as old as the hills."

**Wolf Pack Rule:**
- Journal EVERY trade (entry, exit, thesis, emotions, outcome)
- Study losses harder than wins
- Patterns repeat - learn them

**Trade Journal Template:**
```
Date: Jan 2, 2026
Ticker: AR
Entry: $36.50 | Stop: $34.00 | Size: 400 shares
Thesis: Nat gas breakout, analyst upgrades
Emotion Pre-Entry: Confident, patient
Exit: [TBD]
Outcome: [TBD]
R-Multiple: [TBD]
Lesson: [TBD]
```

### 6. Hunt in Packs: Diversify, Don't Concentrate
**Soros Warning:** "It's not whether you're right or wrong, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong."

**Wolf Pack Rule:**
- Max 8-12% per position (at entry, not at risk)
- Spread across sectors (tech, defense, energy, commodities)
- Correlation kills - if all positions move together, you're over-concentrated

**Portfolio Structure Example:**
- Tech (PLTR, SOUN): 20%
- Defense (SIDU, BBAI): 15%
- Energy (AR): 12%
- Space (LUNR, RKLB): 10%
- Semiconductors (MU): 8%
- Cash: 35% (for opportunities + safety)

---

### 7. Scale Out, Not In
**Jones Method:** "Don't be a hero. Don't have an ego."

**Wolf Pack Rule:**
- Add to WINNERS (pyramid up), never average down losers
- Take profits at milestones, let core position run
- Scale out schedule:
  - T1 (first target): Sell 25%, move stop to breakeven
  - T2 (second target): Sell 35%, trail remaining
  - T3 (trail): Let 40% run with chandelier exit

**AR Exit Plan:**
1. $40 (T1): Sell 100 shares (25%), move stop to $36.50
2. $44 (T2): Sell 140 shares (35% of original), trail at 8%
3. $48+ (T3): Trail remaining 160 shares with chandelier

**NEVER:**
- Add to losing position ("average down")
- Remove stop loss "to give it room"
- Hold through thesis invalidation

---

### 8. Respect the Tape
**Livermore's Law:** "Markets are never wrong - opinions often are."

**Wolf Pack Rule:**
- Price action > our opinion
- Volume confirms moves (high volume breakout = real, low volume = fake)
- If market disagrees with thesis, WE adapt

**Reading the Tape:**
- Strong up-move + high volume = accumulation (BUY)
- Weak up-move + low volume = distribution (SELL)
- Gap up + immediate sell-off = trap (AVOID)
- Slow grind up + increasing volume = sustained move (ADD)

---

### 9. Control the Controllable
**What We Control:**
- Position size
- Stop loss placement
- Entry timing
- Exit strategy
- Emotions (through discipline)

**What We DON'T Control:**
- Market direction
- News/catalysts
- Other traders' actions
- Volatility
- Macro events

**Wolf Pack Focus:**
- Process > outcome
- Perfect execution of strategy > being right
- 10 good trades with 6 wins beats 3 YOLO trades with 2 wins

---

### 10. The Pack Survives Together
**The Ultimate Rule**

**No Revenge Trading:**
- Stopped out? Analyze, don't react emotionally
- Take break after 2 consecutive losses
- Never trade to "get even"

**No Ego:**
- Market doesn't care about your opinion
- Admitting wrong = strength, not weakness
- Cut losses fast, let winners run

**Cash is a Position:**
- If no A+ setups, sit out
- Preservation > action
- "I did nothing today" can be a winning day

## II. Enemy Tactics: What Market Makers Do to You

### The Stop Hunt
**How it works:** MM sees stop cluster at $34, pushes price to $33.90, triggers stops, then reverses

**Defense:**
- Set stops at logical levels (below support), not round numbers
- Use wider stops on volatile stocks
- Accept that some stop hunts happen - better than no stop

### The Fake Breakout
**How it works:** Stock breaks resistance, you buy, immediately reverses (bull trap)

**Defense:**
- Wait for volume confirmation
- Let first 30 min of market settle (avoid open volatility)
- Require 3-5% follow-through before adding

### The Slow Bleed
**How it works:** Stock slowly drops without trigger stops, down 15-20% before you realize

**Defense:**
- Use time stops (if thesis hasn't played out in X days, exit)
- Use trailing stops (chandelier) to lock profits
- Reassess thesis weekly

### The Volatility Crush
**How it works:** You buy options, stock goes nowhere, theta decay kills you

**Defense:**
- Wolf Pack prefers shares over options (for most trades)
- If using options, buy 60+ DTE (days to expiration)
- Never hold options through earnings (IV crush)

## III. Execution Framework

### Pre-Market (6:00-9:30 AM ET)
1. Review overnight news (Bloomberg, CNBC, SEC filings)
2. Check futures (ES, NQ, NG)
3. Scan watchlist for setups
4. Review open positions, adjust stops if needed
5. Write down plan: "Today I will [X]"

### Market Hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
**9:30-10:00 AM:** Let market settle, observe price action  
**10:00 AM-12:00 PM:** Execute planned entries (avoid FOMO chasing)  
**12:00-2:00 PM:** Lunch lull (low volume, avoid trading unless thesis-driven)  
**2:00-4:00 PM:** Manage positions, take profits if targets hit

### After Market (4:00-6:00 PM ET)
1. Journal trades (wins AND losses)
2. Scan SEC filings (Form 4, Form 144, 8-Ks)
3. Update watchlist (add/remove tickers)
4. Review thesis validator (did today's action confirm or deny?)
5. Plan tomorrow: "Tomorrow I will [X]"

## IV. AR Battle Plan - Doctrine Applied

### Entry (Jan 2, 2026)
- **Thesis:** Nat gas breakout ($5.06), AR analyst upgrades ($44-48 targets)
- **Entry:** $36.50 (current price)
- **Stop:** $34.00 (below support)
- **Size:** 400 shares (2% portfolio risk)
- **Catalysts:** Weather, EIA storage reports, earnings (if upcoming)

### Holding
- **Check Form 4/144 daily** (CIK: 0001433270)
- **Monitor nat gas futures** ($NG, UNG ETF)
- **Watch volume** (increasing on up-moves = healthy)
- **Ignore noise** (Twitter, Reddit, CNBC hot takes)

### Exit
- **Stop Hit ($34):** Cut immediately, no questions, journal lesson
- **T1 ($40):** Sell 25%, move stop to breakeven
- **T2 ($44):** Sell 35%, trail with 8% chandelier
- **T3 ($48+):** Let remaining 40% run, trail until stopped

### Invalidation (Cut Even if Stop Not Hit)
- Nat gas breaks below $4.80 (thesis broken)
- Mass insider selling (Form 4s showing sells)
- Earnings miss (if upcoming)
- Sector rotation out of energy
