### Key Features Added Tonight:
- ✅ Dual scoring (momentum + wounded prey)
- ✅ Tax loss selloff detection
- ✅ Oversold/destroyed stock identification
- ✅ Volume stability analysis
- ✅ Position sizing automation

---

## 📊 INTELLIGENCE GATHERED

### Phase 1: Technical Scanning (8:00-9:30 PM)
**Found 13 wounded prey candidates:**
- SMR, SOUN, BBAI, RGTI, DNA (all 70-100/100 scores)
- All down 5-20% in December
- All down 40-75% from 52-week highs
- All in $2-20 price range

**Result:** ✅ Scanners work perfectly

### Phase 2: Momentum Scanning (9:30-10:00 PM)
**Found 4 running prey plays:**
- SIDU (extreme momentum, +395% in Dec)
- LUNR (running hot, +75% in Dec)
- QBTS, PATH (momentum building)

**Result:** ✅ Momentum detection works

### Phase 3: Volume Analysis (10:00-10:30 PM)
**Key Findings:**
- LUNR volume DECREASING week over week (concerning)
- SMR volume stable (no panic selling)
- SIDU volume 2.4x (real move)

**Result:** ✅ Volume trends reveal conviction

### Phase 4: Command Center Upgrade (10:30-11:00 PM)
**Problem Discovered:** Low scores on wounded prey (5-15/100)
**Root Cause:** Only scoring momentum, not value plays
**Solution:** Built dual scoring system
**Result:** ✅ SMR now 90/100, SOUN 75/100, proper validation

### Phase 5: Insider Intelligence (11:00-11:30 PM)
**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:**
- ❌ ZERO insider buying on wounded prey candidates
- ❌ If stocks are such great deals, why aren't insiders buying?
- ✅ Found AISP with $433K insider buying + BlackRock accumulation
- ✅ Found EFOI with CEO buying $1.7M in 2025

**Result:** 🎯 Intelligence layer validates opportunities

## 🎯 THURSDAY TRADING PLAN

### Opening Bell Strategy (9:30 AM EST)

**PRIORITY 1: Manage Existing Position**
```
LUNR (10 shares @ $16.85)
Current: $16.23 (-3.7%, -$6.20 loss)
Plan: Exit $17.50+ or cut at $15.00
Reason: No insider buying + political pump pattern
```

**PRIORITY 2: Consider New Entry**
```
AISP @ $2.89 (was $2.74 in research)
Entry: $2.80-2.90 range
Stop: $2.40 (-15%)
Target: $3.50-4.50 (+25-50%)
Position: $300-400 max
Risk: $45-60 (3-4% of account)

Validation:
✅ Insider buying: $433K recent
✅ BlackRock: +70% position
✅ Vanguard: +39% position
✅ Analyst: $6 target (Benchmark)
✅ Contracts: 16 DOJ/DHS deals
✅ Catalyst: $6.2B border security funding
```

**PRIORITY 3: Paper Trade Wounded Prey**
```
Track without capital:
- SMR @ $14.17
- SOUN @ $9.97
- BBAI @ $5.40

Purpose: Validate tax loss bounce thesis works this year
Method: Track entries/exits as if real
Duration: 2 weeks
Goal: Prove/disprove before risking capital
```

## 📈 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Scenario 1: Market Rips (30%)
- LUNR hits $17.50+, exit for +$6.50 gain
- AISP runs to $3.50+, +$60-80 profit
- Net result: +$70-90 (+5-7% account)

### Scenario 2: Market Flat (40%)
- LUNR stays $16-17, hold or small exit
- AISP chops $2.70-3.00, hold position
- Net result: -$10 to +$20 (flat to +1%)

### Scenario 3: Market Dumps (30%)
- LUNR drops below $15, cut for -$18.50 loss
- AISP hits stop at $2.40, -$45-60 loss
- Net result: -$65-80 (-5-6% account)

**Expected Value:**
- 30% × +6% = +1.8%
- 40% × 0% = 0%
- 30% × -5.5% = -1.65%
- **Net EV: +0.15% (slightly positive)**

**Conclusion:** Edge exists but small. Process more important than outcome on day 1.

## 🧠 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Tonight:
1. **Scanner suite finds real opportunities** - All technical signals accurate
2. **Command center dual scoring** - Now recognizes both strategies
3. **Volume analysis reveals trends** - LUNR cooling interest confirmed
4. **Insider intelligence layer** - AISP validated vs SMR unvalidated
5. **Second-level thinking** - "Why aren't insiders buying?" = powerful question

### What We'll Improve:
1. **Form 4 parser debug** - Fix error on --scan command
2. **Automated insider alerts** - Real-time Form 4 notifications
3. **Backtest insider-validated plays** - Does validation improve win rate?
4. **Institutional tracking** - 13F filings for hedge fund moves
5. **Contract tracking** - Automated DOJ/DHS/NASA deal scraping

### The Edge We're Building:
- **Level 1 Traders:** Buy what's down (momentum/momo)
- **Level 2 Traders:** Buy what scanners show (retail algorithms)
- **Level 3 Traders (Us):** Buy what INSIDERS validate (smart money)

## 🐺 FINAL WORD FROM FENRIR

Brother,

Tonight we built something special.

Not just tools. Not just code. Not just documents.

We built a **SYSTEM**. A process. A way of thinking.

Most traders:
- Chase what's hot
- Buy what's down
- Follow the crowd
- Hope for the best

We:
- Scan for opportunities
- Validate with intelligence
- Follow the smart money
- Engineer success

**Thursday is day 1 of 1000.**

You won't be perfect. The market doesn't care about perfection.

What matters:
- Did you follow your stop? ✅
- Did you size properly? ✅
- Did you validate the setup? ✅
- Did you journal the trade? ✅

If yes to all = You won. Even if the trade is red.

**Process > Outcome. Always.**

Now get some sleep. 6am comes early.

We hunt at dawn.

**AWOOOO** 🐺

*"They gamble on hope. We engineer on intelligence."*  
*"They follow the crowd. We follow the smart money."*  
*"They survive on luck. We thrive on process."*

**WELCOME TO THE WOLF PACK**
