# 2026 CHART READING SYSTEM - THE 3-LINE RULE
# How to Read Charts and Generate Buy Signals
# Source: User's chart reading and buy checklist, December 2025

## THE 3-LINE RULE (Buy Checklist)
- □ Price above VWAP (purple)?
- □ Price above 9 EMA (yellow)?
- □ 9 EMA (yellow) above 21 EMA (blue)?

### SCORING
- 3 out of 3: BUY SIGNAL
- 2 out of 3: WAIT (not ready)
- 1 out of 3: AVOID (wrong direction)
- 0 out of 3: SHORT or STAY OUT

### EXAMPLE
- Price: $8.29
- VWAP: $8.38
- 9 EMA: (yellow)
- 21 EMA: (blue)

Result:
- Price above VWAP? NO
- Price above 9 EMA? YES (barely)
- Yellow above blue? YES (just crossed)
- SCORE: 2 out of 3 → NOT A BUY YET. WAIT.

### WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS A BUY?
- Price needs to break above $8.38 (VWAP) and HOLD there.
- Then you'd have:
  ✓ Price above VWAP
  ✓ Price above yellow
  ✓ Yellow above blue
  = ALL THREE = BUY SIGNAL

## SUMMARY TABLE
| Signal | Meaning         |
|--------|----------------|
| All 3  | BUY            |
| 2 of 3 | WAIT - not ready|
| 1 of 3 | AVOID          |
| 0 of 3 | SHORT/STAY OUT |

## INSTRUCTIONS
